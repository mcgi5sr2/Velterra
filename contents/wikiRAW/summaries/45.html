<p>The gang are travelling through a snowy field. The floor feels… meaty. They are on a battlefield, and the floor is covered in a layer of bodies and a sprinkling of snow.</p>
<p>Diasuke warns there are several weeks of travel north. The snow makes travel conditions tough, but we plod on. The first 5 days pass without incident. Myron and Rip have pointless conversation. Small talk. For 5 days. Exme gets crafty as she is wont to do. Burnie is still struggling with the language. Hes not cut out for this academia. Exme makes shooty toots for Myron.</p>
<p>Kolo approaches Myron. He asks him about “the secrets”. Not the one about having a runny poo. “Bowel function is important though!”. All nod in agreement. No, he means the one where he killed Burnie’s friends. Kolo wonders if Burnie could actually be dead by Myrons hand and is actually an imposter infiltrating the group. Myron says he does want to kill Burnie, and reminisces about his killing days. Myron is bored of talking to Riphard.</p>
<p>“Which time did you go and kill all of Burnie’s friends”.</p>
<p>“Uh, mid afternoon?”.</p>
<p>Kolo posits that both Burnie and Pilch were responsible for killing a bunch o’ burner’s, which one did he do.</p>
<p>“The second one.”</p>
<p>Kolo queries Myron about Riphard’s involvement. He wants to know how much responsibility he takes for current Riphard, whether he was an influence that turned Riphard into the fine man he is today. Myron denies all involvement. Myron tells Kolo all about the day he purged the book Burner’s 40 odd years ago. He remembers it fondly. It turns out Riphard was very young at the time, less than 10. But fully grown, as Dwarves typically are by 2 or 3.</p>
<p>The land is mostly flat, with a sole river lazily winding across the landscape. The are scattered trees about, but it seems most of the land was farmland. Remote huts litter the few ridges, but it seems the occupants have fled the winter… and maybe the war. Snow gently falls consistently, quickly clearing all tracks and traces.</p>
<p>By the 7th day the group are halfway to Fukaniro. The group find the winding river. Chunks of ice float along. There is a bridge with a fallen tree in the middle of it. The stone bridge seems intact. The route seems generally well used. This ain&#39;t no shitty bridge. There are evidence of recent activity despite the snow covering. The tree appears to have been stripped, so unlikely a recent fall.</p>
<p>Burnie shares his limited knowledge of trolls. Myron explains that trolls are actually attracted to shit, not the bridges. Bridges are just where shit collects. Exme says you should never feed the trolls. The gang remembers their previous interactions with trolls. Myrons happy with the tree safety, but looks even closer. As do Burnie and Exme.</p>
<p>Stanri sniffs around, but can only smell Riphards butt. Exme says Rip must have a troll in his butt. Myron is halfway across the bridge. The universe asks for our marching order. Riphard is having a shit under the bridge. Burnie wants to know why people are shitting on this Eddy fellow under bridges.</p>
<p>Burnie sees white shapes masked into the snow on the far side of the bridge start to shift. He is the only person to quickly start fending off the would be white cunts. The throw fucking metal stars at us. A bit on the nose.</p>
<p>Burnie gets twatted twice. And poisoned! Myron, too, gets hit. And Kolo. And Exme… This isn’t looking good. Not Rip though. Cos he’s a boss. But then he gets one right in the neck while he’s feeling smug. Ooft.</p>
<p>Burnie makes the first response to these white coated ninja fuckers. He tries to run over the log asking where the toilet is and complementing their home. Burnie takes one of the men down to the ground.</p>
<p>Myron questions the bridge’s curvature and structure. The bridge is flat. Myron runs away from Burnie, and tries to skip the corner… successfully. He lands in a puff of snow, and with a technique he’s been meaning to try for a while now, he pulled the trigger twice in rapid fire. They both hit. The man looks in some pain.</p>
<p>Kolo casts a minor illusion of Exme “in front of them on top of Stanri, so it looks like there’s 3 people on top.</p>
<p>Riphard is just a fucking badass. Double hit with his gun, while giving everyone the spirit of fire… Except Burnie who has run out of range, while putting everyone else at disadvantage to attack the man he knocked down.</p>
<p>Exme’s connection to the server has been interrupted. Exme starts shouting out random numbers, she might be having a breakdown. “NINEPLUSSEVENPLUSTWELVE”. Weird stuff. She then falls suddenly silent.</p>
<p>Burnie finds ninja’s offensive. His mother was a ninja. “No wonder you never saw her!”</p>
<p>It turns out that the ninja caught Myron’s bullet out of the air, chucking it into the river. Fucking mental mate.</p>
<p>Two ninja’s doubleteam Burnie with their long hard kata’s. Burnie is knocked unconscious by this ravaging. Riphard dodges a couple of throwing stars. Myron katablocks a ninja. Burnie doesn’t die.</p>
<p>Exme puts up a forcefield and shoots through it, significantly wounding one of the ninjas.</p>
<p>Myron ponders some paperwork he forgot to fill in. “Oh yeah… I’ve gotta tick the box”. He focuses on the real matter at hand and grapples the ninja twice. The ninja is a smooth fucking criminal and ninja’s his way out of it. Myron sputters about communism, but it has no effect on the white power ninjas.</p>
<p>Kolo ignores the dying Burnie, until reminded of him by the rest of the group. He turns away in disgust at the blood. Its ruining the beautiful white floor. There are no marines around. He shoots a ninja hovering overing Burnie’s dying soontobecorpse.</p>
<p>Riphard gives Burnie aids. Shocking him back to life… for now. Except he pretends to stay dead.</p>
<p>Stanri bites the shit out of a ninja.</p>
<p>Burnie’s attempt at lying still fails. The aids was too strong and he let out a fart. The ninjas continue to stab the shit out of him. But he somehow riggles out of most of the damage, but is definitely feeling it.</p>
<p>Rip gets a ninjastar to the face, but is feeling BADASS. He thanks himself.</p>
<p>Santri gets stabbed to… death? Do mechabears truly die a death without really living? There is no time to discuss this now.</p>
<p>Burnie is surrounded by ninjas while prone. He stands up. This officially doesn’t cause an opportunity attack the universe decides. Myron is disappointed. Burnie “athletics the guy”... grabbing a ninja by the throat. He disengages one of the other ninjas and drags the ninja with him, dropping him through the hole in the bridge. “WHERE’S THE LIBRARY?!” The ninja gets dunked head first into the river, and gets a bit chilly.</p>
<p>Exme disengages someone and shoots someone else dead. One down.</p>
<p>Myron stabs with gun. He remembers the time the ninja caught his bullet out of the air. That shit was cray. Myron still can’t hit him.</p>
<p>Kolo runs along the bridge, jumping onto the railing. “GET AWAY FROM MY MAAAAAN”, seemingly referring to Burnie? He hits a ninja with a flaming arrow.</p>
<p>Rip heals burnie and preps a smitin’.</p>
<p>Stanri dies a bit.</p>
<p>The water ninja gets colder, and swims desperately over to a rock, trying to haul himself out of the water. He jumps repeatedly between the wet slippery icy rocks. It’s pretty awesome. This ninjas are great. It’s a shame we have to kill them.</p>
<p>The ninjas bumrush Rip and Burnie. The ninja tries to push Burnie through the hole. Burnie desperately clings to the edge, not plunging into the icy depths. He then tries to stab at Burnie, but he amazingly misses. This seems like a comedy sketch. The other ninja stabs Rip. Ouchie.</p>
<p>Burnie pulls off a ninja. He then tries to hide in the log. In the middle of a battle. He does look like a dead tree…</p>
<p>Exme berates Stanri and she fixes him. She then gets on top of him.</p>
<p>Myron sighs, bored of this epic shit ninja duel. “It’s neither of our days, eh?” The ninja nods solemnly. Myron proceeds to miss with 3 attacks. The two of them shrug at each other.</p>
<p>Kolo shoots the ninja next to Rip. He shoots the shit out of him. “I told you to get off my man!”.... Rip?</p>
<p>Rip must whip it. But he does not whip it good.</p>
<p>Stanri stomps across the bridge… in his mind! Psyche. He actually goes over to Myron and claws the fuck out of the pesky ninja.</p>
<p>The originally chilly ninja ninja stars Rip, but he’s made of sturn stuff and appears to shrug off the poison. He does then get stabbed though. Owie. The other other ninja flips back onto the bridge. Myron gets stabbed, but it’s complicated and he hurts a bit, but not too bad.</p>
<p>Burnie jumps out of the log and punches a ninja sideways, trying to send him into the river. The ninja’s are fucking ninja’s though. Clue is in the name. He then disengages and re-engages the other ninja.</p>
<p>Exme shoots at the ninja on Rip, but misses.</p>
<p>Myron stabshoots the ninja to death. Exme invites Myron onto Stanri. “Yeah… alright”.</p>
<p>Kolo shoots at the ninja next to Riphard. He shoots the fuck out of him. Riphard reflects on the irony of a mostly ranged party coming up against ninjas specifically good against ranged attacks.</p>
<p>Riphard cool whips the ninja in the face, exploding in thunderous smite. The ninja is blow back, but not off the bridge.</p>
<p>Stanri bounds onto the bridge.</p>
<p>The now surrounded ninja smoke bombs. Burnie, Myron and Stanri all get shitty opportunity attacks against the smokey boi. Burnie manages to connect with a wild swipe. The ninjas miss with their katas.</p>
<p>Burnie runs across the log… again, and slashes the ninja on Rip. Badly. He just rubs his sword harmlessly against him instead. But it turns out the ninja hates compassionate physical contact and dies of long repressed and untreated physical intimacy issues.</p>
<p>Exme misses.</p>
<p>Myron casually shoots twice at the remaining ninja. The ninja catches a bullet, just like the other one. But it did hurt a bit. He lets out one solitary tear.</p>
<p>Kolo tries to do something complicated involving legs and rolling, ultimately throwing the ninja down the hole “Rey Mysterio style”. It’s pretty sick, but the ninja clings on.</p>
<p>Riphard debates the best shooting angles for a hanging man. He then just shoots him from above. The ninja then falls into the water… again. IT’S THE SAME GUY! This pleases everyone. He gets even fucking chillier. Give that ninja a jumper.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s another ninja that I forgot about. Stanri charges him uselessly.</p>
<p>Burnie tries some ninja shit of his own, and nails it. He then tries to shocker the forgotten ninja, but only vaporizes some surrounding snow.</p>
<p>Exme misses again. She’s pretty off at the moment.</p>
<p>The ninjas takes down Stanri again, and he looks pretty dead now. Or… very inactive? Needs more philosophic debate.</p>
<p>Myron rifles through his back and throws a rope down into the water from the bridge for the ninja, asking for a little chat. Ninja fishing. But the ninja is already dead from hypothermia. He got too chilly. Myron shrugs, takes back his rope, dashes across the bridge and jumps over Stanri’s dying (?) corpse, “like a 60’s car bonnet”. He tries to not kill the ninja, and expresses this to anyone who will listen.</p>
<p>Kolo goes ice fishing for ninja corpse. He gets the corpse … along with a fish! Excellent.</p>
<p>Rip runs through the smoke, but is unaware of the plan to keep the ninja alive. He shoots him pretty sweetly. But he ninja survives!</p>
<p>Stanri doesn’t die.</p>
<p>The ninja looks at his dire situation and honorably stabs himself in the stomach, killing himself instantly.</p>
<p>The battle is over. Exme stabilizes Stanri. Myron inspects the dead ninja bodies. They are in identical uniforms. Myron appreciates the fine tailoring involved, and wants to hunt down the fashion designer. Myron says he shows the ninja the coin, but he didn’t give a shit. He postulates about the ninja origins in relation to the head communist lady, and takes their heads which might come in useful at some point.</p>
<p>The dead bodies on the battlefield were probably “naganatas” (racist?) or farm hands. Myron thinks this could all be important. Myron trails off looking mystified, as though he’s hearing a loud annoying beeping.</p>
<p>Stanri hauls up the frozen ninja corpse for Kolo. Kolo tries to recover the kata’s maybe for their poison or something. Burnie wonders if the katas resemble Iron Maiden, his blade from the woman who killed Otoria. It does in as much as it looks like its from Masuda, but nothing more significant.</p>
<p>Myron spies some tracks he can&#39;t keep track off because of the snow. He questions Kolo’s hatred for normal sized people, and wants him to see if he can hunt down any live ninja that might be in the area. Kolo spazzes out a bit. Kolo senses some humanoids in the region, but from their sparse formation it doesn’t seem that there are any more ninja forces to worry about immediately.</p>
<p>Myron offers Exme some jerky. This is usually the other way round. Exme’s teeth fall out. She grimaces as new adult teeth suddenly sprout from her gums. Myron is horrificly aroused.</p>
<p>The group continue on their travels north for a week. The travels are nervous but uneventful. The nearby inhabitations are… uninhabited. It seems the people migrate somewhere warmer during such harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Exme checks her intelligence. Everyone is confused about this. She is fine and a test goat appears. Burnie is bored of the test goats and wants new features. Typical user. No understanding of the dev work required on the cuber side. The new testgoat is Kolo’s new steed.</p>
<p>The group arrive at Fukaniro. Myron wants Daisuke to ask how to find Fukaniro. “We are in Fukaniro”. Myron laughs at the pathetically small supposed “capital”. The city has some sprawl. There appears to be some class mixing. Riphard is disgusted.</p>
<p>Exme asks around for Lady Imicho, very honestly with probably too much detail. The commoner scrambles away from the horrible looking goblin in front of him. Daisuke interrupts and calmly explains what we’re hear for. The guy says she doesn’t just see anyone. Myron brags about his bag of heads. Daisuke bangs on about Ronin a bit. Myron brags about his foreign status and connections, basicly demanding an audience with Imicho, but it ain’t happening. Riphard flashes his robe, and secures the group a meeting with a local noble that Daisuke already said we should go and see.</p>
<p>Exme talks about pregnancy. Everyone has forgotten who is pregnant. I don’t know either. The group look around the town. There’s a messenger service and Exme sends an express message back to Velterra:</p>
<p>“&quot;How iz the reparez and teh pregnuncy??? exme&quot; signed with a little heart”</p>
<p>It’s still not clear who’s pregnant.</p>
<p>Kolo hunts down a blacksmith. Not just a blacksmith, but the BEST blacksmith. Kolo visits “Calno”, who makes weapons for the local warriors. It’s a very organised smithy with numerous assistants of human and mechanical variety. Hmm, seems like mass produced garbage if you ask me.</p>
<p>Kolo queries for Mr Calno himself. A fat guy waddles out, but actually he’s just so ripped he looks round. He calls us strange. He talks straight to Rip, the most respectable of the bunch, querying him about the goblins and goats. Rip says we are here to set up a carnival/circus thing. “Kolo, do a flip” Kolo doesn’t do a flip. Burnie persuades the guy the goblins are fine for some reason. Exme and Burnie want better armour for Stanri. Exme hands the man very specific details of material specifications. The man is suitably impressed, but suggests some tweaks of his own, musing that it won’t be cheap. Exme gives the man 300gp. “This will do as a deposit”. Another 300gp. “Yes… that is more like it.” Stanri may be learning human words. The group aren’t sure.</p>
<p>Burnie wants to know if Iron Maiden can be improved. The man says he’s made better, but that it is a fine blade that one should be proud of wielding. Burnie asks for at least a fancy scabbard or something. The man don’t know shit about guns though. Kolo wants arrows strong enough to make a sweet batman style grappling hook.</p>
<p>Burnie quizes Exme about aerodynamics and how birds fly. “Because they are aerodynamic!” Burnie studies Masudan economics. It’s really boring. Like all economics.</p>
<p>The group are led to the fancy man, in a nice enough building in the centre of the city. Myron approaches a man in the middle of training outside the house. The level of the fighting is pretty impressive.</p>
<p>Myron rambles a lot. No one understands. Daisuke does her best conveying the mad ramblings to the warrier in training. He says if we were actually all that we should see “Seniya” inside. “It’s a good time for Ronin, war is on the horizon”. Myron expresses that they need to know just how sick we are at being badasses and wants them all to hear about our great exploits. Daisuke resists bragging to the men, but Myron insists, giving extra coin.</p>
<p>Myron breaks out the ping pong table and challenges the warriors to a doubles match. Some of the men tell us to fuck off because they’re busy training. But some younger warriors are intrigued. “Suniya Sunfa and Sunika Sunfa”. They too express a positive attitude to our desire to become Ronin. Myron and Rip look eager to get down to ‘nisness.</p>
<p>The pressure of a first competitive game gets to Riphard and he fluffs his opening shots. Burnie analyses the warriors for their technical training from how they play ping pong. Myron’s experience shines and he casually plays the warriors off the table even without Riphard’s help. “The problem is...you still think ping pong’s a game!” - Myron. Words to live by. Burnie deduces that the warriors are naturally dextrous and poised, and they are all good fighters. Which was already evident to everyone else in the group as stated previously.</p>
<p>Daisuke explains that there are rules to war in Masuda. There is honor and glory here. The common folk start the fight while the nobles and warriors watch over, and it becomes a game of chicken over who will send in their best warriors first, for they are most likely to lose. Imicho bases her warriors off talent rather than status, and this is good for some reason, to have your bestest best fighters not fighting. Ronin are below the “warriors of renown”, but would be part of a second wave in a similar fashion in the event of large scale war.</p>
<p>The group enter the house and there are well dressed men standing around a map. Daisuke whispers that “Akida Satrino” is the noble we are here to see as the general of Imicho’s armies. A black haired middle aged noblewoman turns to face us. Daisuke introduces everyone formally. “You’re a strange bunch of outsiders”. We get that a lot…</p>
<p>She queries us about us taking on the orcs in the mountains, and Exme talks about Raijew. We talk about the ninjas at the bridge we ran into hanging out by the bridge. “Ninja do not just hang out, they strike who they mean to strike” It seems we were targeted by a rival regional leader. She welcomes the potential for more Ronin to join the apparently thin ranks. Exme talks about “people power”.</p>
<p>She asks Daisuke to leave. Daisuke leave. The lady speaks to us in broken, but intelligible Velterran. She says there’s going to be a battle shortly.

There has been a standstill in the battle as striking an enemy could fatally weaken your forces for an attack by one of the other leaders, but this intrusion is too far. There will be a battle in 1 weeks time. There is great risk involved, but there too is great need. She offers us 300gp.

    <textarea readonly class="source" rows="20" cols="20">27/02/18 - Episode 41 - For Fucks Saké

The gang are travelling through a snowy field. The floor feels… meaty. They are on a battlefield, and the floor is covered in a layer of bodies and a sprinkling of snow.

Diasuke warns there are several weeks of travel north. The snow makes travel conditions tough, but we plod on. The first 5 days pass without incident. Myron and Rip have pointless conversation. Small talk. For 5 days. Exme gets crafty as she is wont to do. Burnie is still struggling with the language. Hes not cut out for this academia. Exme makes shooty toots for Myron.

Kolo approaches Myron. He asks him about “the secrets”. Not the one about having a runny poo. “Bowel function is important though!”. All nod in agreement. No, he means the one where he killed Burnie’s friends. Kolo wonders if Burnie could actually be dead by Myrons hand and is actually an imposter infiltrating the group. Myron says he does want to kill Burnie, and reminisces about his killing days. Myron is bored of talking to Riphard.

“Which time did you go and kill all of Burnie’s friends”.

“Uh, mid afternoon?”.

Kolo posits that both Burnie and Pilch were responsible for killing a bunch o’ burner’s, which one did he do.

“The second one.”

Kolo queries Myron about Riphard’s involvement. He wants to know how much responsibility he takes for current Riphard, whether he was an influence that turned Riphard into the fine man he is today. Myron denies all involvement. Myron tells Kolo all about the day he purged the book Burner’s 40 odd years ago. He remembers it fondly. It turns out Riphard was very young at the time, less than 10. But fully grown, as Dwarves typically are by 2 or 3.

The land is mostly flat, with a sole river lazily winding across the landscape. The are scattered trees about, but it seems most of the land was farmland. Remote huts litter the few ridges, but it seems the occupants have fled the winter… and maybe the war. Snow gently falls consistently, quickly clearing all tracks and traces.

By the 7th day the group are halfway to Fukaniro. The group find the winding river. Chunks of ice float along. There is a bridge with a fallen tree in the middle of it. The stone bridge seems intact. The route seems generally well used. This ain't no shitty bridge. There are evidence of recent activity despite the snow covering. The tree appears to have been stripped, so unlikely a recent fall.

Burnie shares his limited knowledge of trolls. Myron explains that trolls are actually attracted to shit, not the bridges. Bridges are just where shit collects. Exme says you should never feed the trolls. The gang remembers their previous interactions with trolls. Myrons happy with the tree safety, but looks even closer. As do Burnie and Exme.

Stanri sniffs around, but can only smell Riphards butt. Exme says Rip must have a troll in his butt. Myron is halfway across the bridge. The universe asks for our marching order. Riphard is having a shit under the bridge. Burnie wants to know why people are shitting on this Eddy fellow under bridges.

Burnie sees white shapes masked into the snow on the far side of the bridge start to shift. He is the only person to quickly start fending off the would be white cunts. The throw fucking metal stars at us. A bit on the nose.

Burnie gets twatted twice. And poisoned! Myron, too, gets hit. And Kolo. And Exme… This isn’t looking good. Not Rip though. Cos he’s a boss. But then he gets one right in the neck while he’s feeling smug. Ooft.

Burnie makes the first response to these white coated ninja fuckers. He tries to run over the log asking where the toilet is and complementing their home. Burnie takes one of the men down to the ground.

Myron questions the bridge’s curvature and structure. The bridge is flat. Myron runs away from Burnie, and tries to skip the corner… successfully. He lands in a puff of snow, and with a technique he’s been meaning to try for a while now, he pulled the trigger twice in rapid fire. They both hit. The man looks in some pain.

Kolo casts a minor illusion of Exme “in front of them on top of Stanri, so it looks like there’s 3 people on top.

Riphard is just a fucking badass. Double hit with his gun, while giving everyone the spirit of fire… Except Burnie who has run out of range, while putting everyone else at disadvantage to attack the man he knocked down.

Exme’s connection to the server has been interrupted. Exme starts shouting out random numbers, she might be having a breakdown. “NINEPLUSSEVENPLUSTWELVE”. Weird stuff. She then falls suddenly silent.

Burnie finds ninja’s offensive. His mother was a ninja. “No wonder you never saw her!”

It turns out that the ninja caught Myron’s bullet out of the air, chucking it into the river. Fucking mental mate.

Two ninja’s doubleteam Burnie with their long hard kata’s. Burnie is knocked unconscious by this ravaging. Riphard dodges a couple of throwing stars. Myron katablocks a ninja. Burnie doesn’t die.

Exme puts up a forcefield and shoots through it, significantly wounding one of the ninjas.

Myron ponders some paperwork he forgot to fill in. “Oh yeah… I’ve gotta tick the box”. He focuses on the real matter at hand and grapples the ninja twice. The ninja is a smooth fucking criminal and ninja’s his way out of it. Myron sputters about communism, but it has no effect on the white power ninjas.

Kolo ignores the dying Burnie, until reminded of him by the rest of the group. He turns away in disgust at the blood. Its ruining the beautiful white floor. There are no marines around. He shoots a ninja hovering overing Burnie’s dying soontobecorpse.

Riphard gives Burnie aids. Shocking him back to life… for now. Except he pretends to stay dead.

Stanri bites the shit out of a ninja.

Burnie’s attempt at lying still fails. The aids was too strong and he let out a fart. The ninjas continue to stab the shit out of him. But he somehow riggles out of most of the damage, but is definitely feeling it.

Rip gets a ninjastar to the face, but is feeling BADASS. He thanks himself.

Santri gets stabbed to… death? Do mechabears truly die a death without really living? There is no time to discuss this now.

Burnie is surrounded by ninjas while prone. He stands up. This officially doesn’t cause an opportunity attack the universe decides. Myron is disappointed. Burnie “athletics the guy”... grabbing a ninja by the throat. He disengages one of the other ninjas and drags the ninja with him, dropping him through the hole in the bridge. “WHERE’S THE LIBRARY?!” The ninja gets dunked head first into the river, and gets a bit chilly.

Exme disengages someone and shoots someone else dead. One down.

Myron stabs with gun. He remembers the time the ninja caught his bullet out of the air. That shit was cray. Myron still can’t hit him.

Kolo runs along the bridge, jumping onto the railing. “GET AWAY FROM MY MAAAAAN”, seemingly referring to Burnie? He hits a ninja with a flaming arrow.

Rip heals burnie and preps a smitin’.

Stanri dies a bit.

The water ninja gets colder, and swims desperately over to a rock, trying to haul himself out of the water. He jumps repeatedly between the wet slippery icy rocks. It’s pretty awesome. This ninjas are great. It’s a shame we have to kill them.

The ninjas bumrush Rip and Burnie. The ninja tries to push Burnie through the hole. Burnie desperately clings to the edge, not plunging into the icy depths. He then tries to stab at Burnie, but he amazingly misses. This seems like a comedy sketch. The other ninja stabs Rip. Ouchie.

Burnie pulls off a ninja. He then tries to hide in the log. In the middle of a battle. He does look like a dead tree…

Exme berates Stanri and she fixes him. She then gets on top of him.

Myron sighs, bored of this epic shit ninja duel. “It’s neither of our days, eh?” The ninja nods solemnly. Myron proceeds to miss with 3 attacks. The two of them shrug at each other.

Kolo shoots the ninja next to Rip. He shoots the shit out of him. “I told you to get off my man!”.... Rip?

Rip must whip it. But he does not whip it good.

Stanri stomps across the bridge… in his mind! Psyche. He actually goes over to Myron and claws the fuck out of the pesky ninja.

The originally chilly ninja ninja stars Rip, but he’s made of sturn stuff and appears to shrug off the poison. He does then get stabbed though. Owie. The other other ninja flips back onto the bridge. Myron gets stabbed, but it’s complicated and he hurts a bit, but not too bad.

Burnie jumps out of the log and punches a ninja sideways, trying to send him into the river. The ninja’s are fucking ninja’s though. Clue is in the name. He then disengages and re-engages the other ninja.

Exme shoots at the ninja on Rip, but misses.

Myron stabshoots the ninja to death. Exme invites Myron onto Stanri. “Yeah… alright”.

Kolo shoots at the ninja next to Riphard. He shoots the fuck out of him. Riphard reflects on the irony of a mostly ranged party coming up against ninjas specifically good against ranged attacks.

Riphard cool whips the ninja in the face, exploding in thunderous smite. The ninja is blow back, but not off the bridge.

Stanri bounds onto the bridge.

The now surrounded ninja smoke bombs. Burnie, Myron and Stanri all get shitty opportunity attacks against the smokey boi. Burnie manages to connect with a wild swipe. The ninjas miss with their katas.

Burnie runs across the log… again, and slashes the ninja on Rip. Badly. He just rubs his sword harmlessly against him instead. But it turns out the ninja hates compassionate physical contact and dies of long repressed and untreated physical intimacy issues.

Exme misses.

Myron casually shoots twice at the remaining ninja. The ninja catches a bullet, just like the other one. But it did hurt a bit. He lets out one solitary tear.

Kolo tries to do something complicated involving legs and rolling, ultimately throwing the ninja down the hole “Rey Mysterio style”. It’s pretty sick, but the ninja clings on.

Riphard debates the best shooting angles for a hanging man. He then just shoots him from above. The ninja then falls into the water… again. IT’S THE SAME GUY! This pleases everyone. He gets even fucking chillier. Give that ninja a jumper.

But wait, there’s another ninja that I forgot about. Stanri charges him uselessly.

Burnie tries some ninja shit of his own, and nails it. He then tries to shocker the forgotten ninja, but only vaporizes some surrounding snow.

Exme misses again. She’s pretty off at the moment.

The ninjas takes down Stanri again, and he looks pretty dead now. Or… very inactive? Needs more philosophic debate.

Myron rifles through his back and throws a rope down into the water from the bridge for the ninja, asking for a little chat. Ninja fishing. But the ninja is already dead from hypothermia. He got too chilly. Myron shrugs, takes back his rope, dashes across the bridge and jumps over Stanri’s dying (?) corpse, “like a 60’s car bonnet”. He tries to not kill the ninja, and expresses this to anyone who will listen.

Kolo goes ice fishing for ninja corpse. He gets the corpse … along with a fish! Excellent.

Rip runs through the smoke, but is unaware of the plan to keep the ninja alive. He shoots him pretty sweetly. But he ninja survives!

Stanri doesn’t die.

The ninja looks at his dire situation and honorably stabs himself in the stomach, killing himself instantly.

The battle is over. Exme stabilizes Stanri. Myron inspects the dead ninja bodies. They are in identical uniforms. Myron appreciates the fine tailoring involved, and wants to hunt down the fashion designer. Myron says he shows the ninja the coin, but he didn’t give a shit. He postulates about the ninja origins in relation to the head communist lady, and takes their heads which might come in useful at some point.

The dead bodies on the battlefield were probably “naganatas” (racist?) or farm hands. Myron thinks this could all be important. Myron trails off looking mystified, as though he’s hearing a loud annoying beeping.

Stanri hauls up the frozen ninja corpse for Kolo. Kolo tries to recover the kata’s maybe for their poison or something. Burnie wonders if the katas resemble Iron Maiden, his blade from the woman who killed Otoria. It does in as much as it looks like its from Masuda, but nothing more significant.

Myron spies some tracks he can't keep track off because of the snow. He questions Kolo’s hatred for normal sized people, and wants him to see if he can hunt down any live ninja that might be in the area. Kolo spazzes out a bit. Kolo senses some humanoids in the region, but from their sparse formation it doesn’t seem that there are any more ninja forces to worry about immediately.

Myron offers Exme some jerky. This is usually the other way round. Exme’s teeth fall out. She grimaces as new adult teeth suddenly sprout from her gums. Myron is horrificly aroused.

The group continue on their travels north for a week. The travels are nervous but uneventful. The nearby inhabitations are… uninhabited. It seems the people migrate somewhere warmer during such harsh conditions.

Exme checks her intelligence. Everyone is confused about this. She is fine and a test goat appears. Burnie is bored of the test goats and wants new features. Typical user. No understanding of the dev work required on the cuber side. The new testgoat is Kolo’s new steed.

The group arrive at Fukaniro. Myron wants Daisuke to ask how to find Fukaniro. “We are in Fukaniro”. Myron laughs at the pathetically small supposed “capital”. The city has some sprawl. There appears to be some class mixing. Riphard is disgusted.

Exme asks around for Lady Imicho, very honestly with probably too much detail. The commoner scrambles away from the horrible looking goblin in front of him. Daisuke interrupts and calmly explains what we’re hear for. The guy says she doesn’t just see anyone. Myron brags about his bag of heads. Daisuke bangs on about Ronin a bit. Myron brags about his foreign status and connections, basicly demanding an audience with Imicho, but it ain’t happening. Riphard flashes his robe, and secures the group a meeting with a local noble that Daisuke already said we should go and see.

Exme talks about pregnancy. Everyone has forgotten who is pregnant. I don’t know either. The group look around the town. There’s a messenger service and Exme sends an express message back to Velterra:

“&quot;How iz the reparez and teh pregnuncy??? exme&quot; signed with a little heart”

It’s still not clear who’s pregnant.

Kolo hunts down a blacksmith. Not just a blacksmith, but the BEST blacksmith. Kolo visits “Calno”, who makes weapons for the local warriors. It’s a very organised smithy with numerous assistants of human and mechanical variety. Hmm, seems like mass produced garbage if you ask me.

Kolo queries for Mr Calno himself. A fat guy waddles out, but actually he’s just so ripped he looks round. He calls us strange. He talks straight to Rip, the most respectable of the bunch, querying him about the goblins and goats. Rip says we are here to set up a carnival/circus thing. “Kolo, do a flip” Kolo doesn’t do a flip. Burnie persuades the guy the goblins are fine for some reason. Exme and Burnie want better armour for Stanri. Exme hands the man very specific details of material specifications. The man is suitably impressed, but suggests some tweaks of his own, musing that it won’t be cheap. Exme gives the man 300gp. “This will do as a deposit”. Another 300gp. “Yes… that is more like it.” Stanri may be learning human words. The group aren’t sure.

Burnie wants to know if Iron Maiden can be improved. The man says he’s made better, but that it is a fine blade that one should be proud of wielding. Burnie asks for at least a fancy scabbard or something. The man don’t know shit about guns though. Kolo wants arrows strong enough to make a sweet batman style grappling hook.

Burnie quizes Exme about aerodynamics and how birds fly. “Because they are aerodynamic!” Burnie studies Masudan economics. It’s really boring. Like all economics.

The group are led to the fancy man, in a nice enough building in the centre of the city. Myron approaches a man in the middle of training outside the house. The level of the fighting is pretty impressive.

Myron rambles a lot. No one understands. Daisuke does her best conveying the mad ramblings to the warrier in training. He says if we were actually all that we should see “Seniya” inside. “It’s a good time for Ronin, war is on the horizon”. Myron expresses that they need to know just how sick we are at being badasses and wants them all to hear about our great exploits. Daisuke resists bragging to the men, but Myron insists, giving extra coin.

Myron breaks out the ping pong table and challenges the warriors to a doubles match. Some of the men tell us to fuck off because they’re busy training. But some younger warriors are intrigued. “Suniya Sunfa and Sunika Sunfa”. They too express a positive attitude to our desire to become Ronin. Myron and Rip look eager to get down to ‘nisness.

The pressure of a first competitive game gets to Riphard and he fluffs his opening shots. Burnie analyses the warriors for their technical training from how they play ping pong. Myron’s experience shines and he casually plays the warriors off the table even without Riphard’s help. “The problem is...you still think ping pong’s a game!” - Myron. Words to live by.
