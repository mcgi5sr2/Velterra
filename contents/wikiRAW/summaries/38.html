<p>Place: The sky(sea)ship Gary    </p>
<p>Destination: Masuda    </p>
<p>Well diary, I really haven’t been feeling like myself lately but hopefully that feeling has passed now. Jeremey apparently disappeared into nothing. No-one really knows what happened but equally so, no-one cares.    </p>
<p>I’ve spent a lot of time trying to fix the skyship after we got attacked into the see. I did manage to get the propulsion systems working so now we can use it like a boat which is not as cool as an airship but we won’t be able fly until we get parts from Masuda. Whilst we’ve been at sea we came across an old man who calls himself Burnie. He seemed to hate Pilch and wanted to kill him but now he knows Pilch isn’t dead. He is contemplatating this and reading through his notes. I have a horrible feeling Mark has penterated him.    </p>
<p>Myron seems distant.    </p>
<p>Kolo has cultivated a new plant and now sits in his room listening to loud music and not talking to anyone. Should keep an eye on this.    </p>
<p>I’ve been been busy working on a little project. Tee hee hee. Secret.    </p>
<p>Riphard has been busy making some items for the expectant baby. He seems to have really mellowed being all faced with the prospect of fatherhood. I saw him sat by the fire last night knitting a little chain mail vest for a baby sized. #socute.    </p>
<p>We finally arrived into a bustiling harbour town port. We left Delilah and Rubriks-sensei to oversee the repairs. We have come to Masuda to find some of the more artefacts, specifically the HAMMER OF THE GODS which was brought to Masuda during an ill fated crusade a long time ago. Hopefully the puzzle die can lead us to it. It was incredibly bustiling. The first thing we noticed was that everyone was talking a very odd language which sounded liek that thing lady otoria got shotued at. Burnie doesn’t seem to remember that we went into the past and saw everything about him. I decided that the first thing that needed doing was secure some raw materials. Bernie, Rippy and me went looking round the very odd streets. So many humans everywhere. Eventually we found a blacksmith eventually. Communication immediately seemed to be a barrier. Burnie decided that maybe the man in the shop could wear my helmet to understand us. He viciously shook it at the man’s head and the man didn’t look happy. He resorted to violence. It didn’t work but I managed to get across what needed to be done. We managed to figure it out. Unfortunately the greedy army was gobbling up all the resources for their big war, so it was going to take us a few weeks to get all the things we needed. I paid the man 500 GP for the materials and Riphard promised to pay it all back later on from the bank.    </p>
<p>Bernie asks about the Iron Maiden sword - it’s already a good one of its type. He asks about a translator or guide - smithy recommends (in its native tongue) - The Grasshoppers chirp merrily in grass - in Masudan (Burnie can regurgitate it).    </p>
<p>Go to tavern - near the docks. There’s an elf-man by the bar. He doesn’t own an elk.    </p>
<p>Bernie gets a supply of masudan change. We get food and booze. We ask about the war    </p>
<p>King of Masuda - Yasuda Ingoro - was murdered a few years ago. Ingoro was known as the “Unifier” - unifying the city states of Masuda. In the last century or so there wasn’t a country - separate bickering states. Ingoro brought an end to that. Murdered in suspicious circumstances - hadn’t declared which of his 4 children would succeed. As they’d never had a royalty, there wasn’t an agreed term of succession - hence the war - the 4 children fight for control of the country - splitting the country into 4 rough regions.    </p>
<p>Yasuda Montoyo - Central - Eldest son. Holds capital and largest area. Default successor? But not a strong ruler - lacking charisma. Ruthless. Petty. Surrounded by a lot of upstart nobles (young) who are manipulative of him.    </p>
<p>Yasuda Anigaya - Southern Masuda - Staunchly conservative, believes country was lead to downfall by acceptance of robotic workers, clockwork geishas - believes masuda needs to live by traditional values.    </p>
<p>Yasuda Imicho (female) - Mid Masuda - Believe not fit to rule (due to brothers). Is a good tactician, but lacks support due to strange believes. Believes separation between nobility and peasants is wrong - not popular.    </p>
<p>Yasuda Orochi - Northern Masuda - popular across the board. Too isolationist and needs to open up - especially with near neighbours of Nanduan - one of the more unpopular beliefs. Apparently impossible for him to produce and heir due to him favouring male lovers.    </p>
<p>I listened more than Burnie and got the following.    </p>
<p>Central Masuda - ruled by Yasuda Montoyo - The eldest son of Ingoro, holds the capital city of Masuda and the largest area of land. Seen as the default successor but not seen as a strong ruler due to his ruthlessness and lack of charisma. He is surrounded by upstart noblemen who believe they can manipulate him to their own ends.    </p>
<p>Southern Masuda - ruled by Yasuda Anigaya - a staunchly conservative Masudan who believes that the country was led to its downfall by the acceptance of robotic workers and the Clockwerk Geishas. Believes that Masuda needs to live by its traditional code.    </p>
<p>Mid Masuda - ruled by Yasuda Imicho - Imicho is only daughter of the king. Some believe she is not fit to rule when she has brothers, however she has shown herself to be strong on the battlefield and good at both diplomacy and tactics. She lacks support from other areas though due to her strange beliefs - that the nobility and the peasant classes should not be separated. She has a member of the peasant class as her lover which many believe would defile the ruling lineage.    </p>
<p>Northern Masuda - ruled by Yasuda Orochi - A calm and collected ruler, good with people and popular with nobles and the common classes. Believes that Masuda has been to isolationist and needs to open up to relations with their long-time rivals in Nanduan. Orochi is also very unlikely to produce an heir due to his relationships with other men, which many worry will lead to another war for succession should he pass    </p>
<p>Myron managed to catch up with us and walked into the bar. He was quiet. He set his dirnk on fire and then he made a funny joke. Sigh. He taught us about how to speak to local people by speaking louder and slower. It was good to see Myron up on his legs again after weeks of drinking rum and salt water. The squinty eyed bar man said that the church doesn’t really have a presence here. I decided to give him his present of the new communicator beans. He looked very happy and I felt so warm and happy too. I decided to give Burnie and Riphard one too. We should be able to talk to eachotehr now even if we’re really far away. :)    </p>
<p>A man in purpley robes came into the room and told us that he had heard we needed a translator for our time in the city. Burnie seemed to be taking the lead which was quite presumptuous of him. The man wanted lots of gold so Burnie tried to barter him down a bit citing “diplowmatic business”. The man seemed honoured and agreed to only need 1000 GP for the two weeks. Burnie apparently speaks Gabrinish, and is asking us for money which seems a bit familiar. Myron made a joke I think about maybe killing the man after we pay him. Kolo would not have laughed. I suggested we ask if he could just translate every other word to half the price. Burnie wasn’t clever enough to understand this. He paid the man like a chump and then asked him about squating bathrooms. The man asked Burnie about me and called me a gabrin slave. The cheek of it. Burnie even said that I was his slave and did not even have a name. I swear to the chosen one, I very nearly pressed the self-destruct button for his ear bean right there and then. The man is called Daisuke. Daisuke offered to take us around the town to see all the sites and Myron asked about the local sports like bridge jumping and cows. Daisuke said that they enjoyed playing ping pong, which appears to be a game where you try to keep things on a table. Myron said he was a very good pingponger and Burnie wanted to see if people could play for money. Daisuke started telling us about the robots and the robot geishas and the robot workers. Myron was very keen for the pong ping and Daisuke led us to a back alley ping pong tournament. On the way Myron told us all about the “good old days” when he was paying his way through arbiter school by playing this game and how it all went to pot when he had to grow up and get a real job saving people. He still even had his bats after 50 years of not playing.    </p>
<p>The ping pong room was very dark and there were lots of Masuda business men playing serious ping pong. The fat man at the door had a manduan conversation with Daisuke and agreed to let us in. He greeted the man with the old ping pong phrase of good fortune “may the spin forever be in your favour”. I was very excited to see him play. Him and Burnie went to a free table and Myron looked handsomely across the table which was easy because it was at his eye level. He took out a little ball and hit it across the table with a little paddle. Burnie hit it back and Myron nodded his approval. The ball went back and forth, back and forth. It was so exciting I forgot all about the fact that we were in the middle of an active war zone on a downed airship with a heavily pregnant woman, and in need of finding magical artefacts of immense power in order to save the world from the tyranny of a terrible oppresive force. For now, watching people hitting a little ball back and forth was all that we needed. Riphard and I drank the warm sacky drink and clapped when appropriate (when Myron won!). Myron was keen for new challengers and a long haired greasy man seemed to be ready to be beaten by the gnome. Burnie leant close to Myrons ear and seemed to whisper him some advice. Myron seemed not to notice. Myron seemed to be playing the long game rather than the short long game, masterfully deceiving his component into a false sense of security by losing the first games. But then he became slightly ahead. The crowd didn’t look so happy at Myron’s lead. Finally Myron hit the ball so hard that the ball exploded onto the edge of the table and span away, the defeated opponent collapsing to his knees and weeping like a little human. Daisuke suggested we better leave because the people were too happy about Myron’s winning. Myron wanted more victory. Daisuke found him a new opponent, a young lean man with a red bandage around his head. Clearly he was wounded recently so it did not seem fair to put him against Myron. It was not even a challenge for Myron. Everyone got excited so we had to leave.    </p>
<p>We went back to the ship and I asked Rubrik’s Sensei to aid me in unlocking the secrets of the cube. He told me to believe in myself. I believed in myself so hard that I learned how to summon goats. The cube lifted into the air and started rotating all its sides around and I understood inside my head that the hammer was in Masuda. Myron let Daisuke know that we needed to head to Masuda and asked for advice. Daisuke said we would not even be allowed into Masuda because we were commons. Not even being diplohmats or lady harxmbes would not even be good enough. Burnie tried to make a plan about farms. Then there was a plan involving bribes that Daisuke daisuked much more. Daisuke suggested that we join a war family and maybe we could get in that way. Myron offered his thought on regicide which made a lot of sense. Then he made the point that maybe its better to sneak into a city than to take it by force with a whole army. Daisuke tells us we need to go roamin. Then we will be unaligned warriors with valour and actions. And we will need to prove ourselves. Confusing. I went to check on Delilah while Myron went to drink some seawater.    </p>
<p>Myron found me a little later on, and he said he wanted to tell me his idea. He was saying that he had an idea to put his thing in mine so it would make a big bang. I nearly fainted. When I started paying attention again and could feel my face I realised he was talking about putting gunpowder into my projectiles. It was a good idea indeed and I decided to try and make some over the night. I went to check on Kolo. He didn’t answer the door but slid out a couple of packages of ails’ya under the door. I hope he is okay. I checked in on Delilah too. Couldn’t hear the baby through her ankle. Guessing it’s coming soon. We should probably make sure we get some more towels in. The next morning we remembered that we didn’t really know what we were doing. More so than usual. Burnie asked Daisuke where all the headquarters were for all the people that we might decided to work for. Myron still had his doubts about attacking a city. Burnie asked how we can become roamin and we have to basically be heroic again. Myron once again voiced his concerns with the idea of insurgency. It did sound quite complicated when he laid it out in full. Burnie tried to be wise but it didn’t work because speaking and talking are the same thing. We discussed the pros and cons of becoming roamins. We decided after a lot of discussion that we would become roamins. Burnie asked about cigarettes and the lady king and Daisuke said that they had a lot in common but also not much in common and there was complications. Burnie’s belt is made from a monkey’s tail. Bold. I think we decided to be heroes. We sent Daisuke away to find us some heroic things to do. We went to visit our blacksmith friend again. He was much more animated this time. Myron had a bit of fun playing with the accent dial on my helmet but then went back to original. The man told us his name was bokedonk and he could sell us the black powder that we needed. We stocked up and I made the Myron Rounds and we went on our merry way.    </p>
<p>By the time we got back Daisuke had returned and found two potential fun activities for us to do. The first was a stronghold of orcs up to the east who are terrorsing the locals and need clearing out. The other is just to the north over the fields and far away where a lot of farms have been impacted by a creature called Raijyuu, the lightning beast. A fast runner to by all accounts, scorching the earth in its wake. Burnie suggested he wear rubber trousers to hide the urine which seemed wise for a man of his age. Myron knows all the ins and outs of defending farms. He thought the lightning creature might make lightning out of his glans. Burnie tried to ingragiate himself in front of us but we quickly put a stop to it. Those things are better behind closed doors. He took out a small chest and opened the complicated locking mechanism with three hands somehow. He pulled out some small items and gave them to us. Rippy got a whip that looked nice. Burnie called it the ‘whip of the roses’ which was form the arcanist man in the past and looks pretty sick. What a cool whip. I got a nice blueprint that looks like it is for a streamlined bullet that goes fast and can go through defenses. He got a bow for Kolo and put it by his door. He then pulled out a teapot and looked confused before passing it to Myron. Myron was already full of sea water so he politely declined. Apparently it had a secret spout and it was magical so it made poison. Myron decided he would have it and politely put it in the kitchen. I suggested he put a label on it to warn people that it had poison in it. Hoepfully that will ensure that there are no accidental drinkings. I was confused about the plan so Myron explained it again. Daisuke warned us to watch out for sanddaggers on the way which are very fast and you can’t run away from them. Lady Otoria always used to say these were bad too. With that happy thought, we set off on our journey to become noble roamins.    </p>
<p>Epilogue:    </p>
<p>Archibald had the uncanny feeling that he was being watched, and not for the first time that evening. The coldness of the harsh winter night was creeping in through the various cracks and broken windows that still needed to be fixed. Somewhere outside he heard the call of a bird, ringing out through the night. Long and drawn out, almost mournful. It made him shiver. He decided to finish up his evening checks a little quicker, the vault could wait until tomorrow. As he left the kitchen he noticed the back door was open, blowing in the wind and banging against its frame. He was sure it had been locked. He walked over, with trepidation, every sense heightened and every hair on the back of his neck standing on end. There it was again, that feeling of being watched. Turning around quickly he found himself alone. It was just his nerves, his old frayed nerves and nothing more. Although he wouldn’t admit it, he’d be glad when the new masters returned from their foreign travels. The roughians who had taken over the upper floors never talked to him and the building was far too big and lonely for one elderly man. He approached the door and went to grasp the handle, but as he reached for it he noticed the broken lock and the damage to the frame. The lights went out and he felt a movement behind him, fast and hard and heavy, a body leapt out at him and pushed him to the ground. He couldn’t move, a mixture of the stranger’s weight and his own shock forcing him into a state of panic. The mass reached out to him and turned him around. Against every instinct, Archibald opened his eyes and stared at the terror in front of him. Two impossibly large beady eyes, one black and one blood red stared at him, portraying a desperate wildness that offered a stark juxtaposition to the expressionless face that held them. A face that seemed to be half man, half bird and all torment. The creature that lay on him pressed down harder and lowered its disfigured beak to his ear. Before he passed out, Archibald heard the four cruel-sounding words that came out of it. “WheRee … iss. . my... . . FatTtherrR?!?!”....</p>

Place: The sky(sea)ship Gary    

    

Destination: Masuda    

    

Well diary, I really haven’t been feeling like myself lately but hopefully that feeling has passed now. Jeremey apparently disappeared into nothing. No-one really knows what happened but equally so, no-one cares.    

    

I’ve spent a lot of time trying to fix the skyship after we got attacked into the see. I did manage to get the propulsion systems working so now we can use it like a boat which is not as cool as an airship but we won’t be able fly until we get parts from Masuda. Whilst we’ve been at sea we came across an old man who calls himself Burnie. He seemed to hate Pilch and wanted to kill him but now he knows Pilch isn’t dead. He is contemplatating this and reading through his notes. I have a horrible feeling Mark has penterated him.    

    

Myron seems distant.    

    

Kolo has cultivated a new plant and now sits in his room listening to loud music and not talking to anyone. Should keep an eye on this.    

    

I’ve been been busy working on a little project. Tee hee hee. Secret.    

    

Riphard has been busy making some items for the expectant baby. He seems to have really mellowed being all faced with the prospect of fatherhood. I saw him sat by the fire last night knitting a little chain mail vest for a baby sized. #socute.    

    

We finally arrived into a bustiling harbour town port. We left Delilah and Rubriks-sensei to oversee the repairs. We have come to Masuda to find some of the more artefacts, specifically the HAMMER OF THE GODS which was brought to Masuda during an ill fated crusade a long time ago. Hopefully the puzzle die can lead us to it. It was incredibly bustiling. The first thing we noticed was that everyone was talking a very odd language which sounded liek that thing lady otoria got shotued at. Burnie doesn’t seem to remember that we went into the past and saw everything about him. I decided that the first thing that needed doing was secure some raw materials. Bernie, Rippy and me went looking round the very odd streets. So many humans everywhere. Eventually we found a blacksmith eventually. Communication immediately seemed to be a barrier. Burnie decided that maybe the man in the shop could wear my helmet to understand us. He viciously shook it at the man’s head and the man didn’t look happy. He resorted to violence. It didn’t work but I managed to get across what needed to be done. We managed to figure it out. Unfortunately the greedy army was gobbling up all the resources for their big war, so it was going to take us a few weeks to get all the things we needed. I paid the man 500 GP for the materials and Riphard promised to pay it all back later on from the bank.    

    

Bernie asks about the Iron Maiden sword - it’s already a good one of its type. He asks about a translator or guide - smithy recommends (in its native tongue) - The Grasshoppers chirp merrily in grass - in Masudan (Burnie can regurgitate it).    

    

Go to tavern - near the docks. There’s an elf-man by the bar. He doesn’t own an elk.    

    

Bernie gets a supply of masudan change. We get food and booze. We ask about the war    

    

King of Masuda - Yasuda Ingoro - was murdered a few years ago. Ingoro was known as the “Unifier” - unifying the city states of Masuda. In the last century or so there wasn’t a country - separate bickering states. Ingoro brought an end to that. Murdered in suspicious circumstances - hadn’t declared which of his 4 children would succeed. As they’d never had a royalty, there wasn’t an agreed term of succession - hence the war - the 4 children fight for control of the country - splitting the country into 4 rough regions.    

    

Yasuda Montoyo - Central - Eldest son. Holds capital and largest area. Default successor? But not a strong ruler - lacking charisma. Ruthless. Petty. Surrounded by a lot of upstart nobles (young) who are manipulative of him.    

    

Yasuda Anigaya - Southern Masuda - Staunchly conservative, believes country was lead to downfall by acceptance of robotic workers, clockwork geishas - believes masuda needs to live by traditional values.    

    

Yasuda Imicho (female) - Mid Masuda - Believe not fit to rule (due to brothers). Is a good tactician, but lacks support due to strange believes. Believes separation between nobility and peasants is wrong - not popular.    

    

Yasuda Orochi - Northern Masuda - popular across the board. Too isolationist and needs to open up - especially with near neighbours of Nanduan - one of the more unpopular beliefs. Apparently impossible for him to produce and heir due to him favouring male lovers.    

    

I listened more than Burnie and got the following.    

    

Central Masuda - ruled by Yasuda Montoyo - The eldest son of Ingoro, holds the capital city of Masuda and the largest area of land. Seen as the default successor but not seen as a strong ruler due to his ruthlessness and lack of charisma. He is surrounded by upstart noblemen who believe they can manipulate him to their own ends.    

    

Southern Masuda - ruled by Yasuda Anigaya - a staunchly conservative Masudan who believes that the country was led to its downfall by the acceptance of robotic workers and the Clockwerk Geishas. Believes that Masuda needs to live by its traditional code.    

    

Mid Masuda - ruled by Yasuda Imicho - Imicho is only daughter of the king. Some believe she is not fit to rule when she has brothers, however she has shown herself to be strong on the battlefield and good at both diplomacy and tactics. She lacks support from other areas though due to her strange beliefs - that the nobility and the peasant classes should not be separated. She has a member of the peasant class as her lover which many believe would defile the ruling lineage.    

    

Northern Masuda - ruled by Yasuda Orochi - A calm and collected ruler, good with people and popular with nobles and the common classes. Believes that Masuda has been to isolationist and needs to open up to relations with their long-time rivals in Nanduan. Orochi is also very unlikely to produce an heir due to his relationships with other men, which many worry will lead to another war for succession should he pass    

    

Myron managed to catch up with us and walked into the bar. He was quiet. He set his dirnk on fire and then he made a funny joke. Sigh. He taught us about how to speak to local people by speaking louder and slower. It was good to see Myron up on his legs again after weeks of drinking rum and salt water. The squinty eyed bar man said that the church doesn’t really have a presence here. I decided to give him his present of the new communicator beans. He looked very happy and I felt so warm and happy too. I decided to give Burnie and Riphard one too. We should be able to talk to eachotehr now even if we’re really far away. :)    

    

A man in purpley robes came into the room and told us that he had heard we needed a translator for our time in the city. Burnie seemed to be taking the lead which was quite presumptuous of him. The man wanted lots of gold so Burnie tried to barter him down a bit citing “diplowmatic business”. The man seemed honoured and agreed to only need 1000 GP for the two weeks. Burnie apparently speaks Gabrinish, and is asking us for money which seems a bit familiar. Myron made a joke I think about maybe killing the man after we pay him. Kolo would not have laughed. I suggested we ask if he could just translate every other word to half the price. Burnie wasn’t clever enough to understand this. He paid the man like a chump and then asked him about squating bathrooms. The man asked Burnie about me and called me a gabrin slave. The cheek of it. Burnie even said that I was his slave and did not even have a name. I swear to the chosen one, I very nearly pressed the self-destruct button for his ear bean right there and then. The man is called Daisuke. Daisuke offered to take us around the town to see all the sites and Myron asked about the local sports like bridge jumping and cows. Daisuke said that they enjoyed playing ping pong, which appears to be a game where you try to keep things on a table. Myron said he was a very good pingponger and Burnie wanted to see if people could play for money. Daisuke started telling us about the robots and the robot geishas and the robot workers. Myron was very keen for the pong ping and Daisuke led us to a back alley ping pong tournament. On the way Myron told us all about the “good old days” when he was paying his way through arbiter school by playing this game and how it all went to pot when he had to grow up and get a real job saving people. He still even had his bats after 50 years of not playing.    

    

The ping pong room was very dark and there were lots of Masuda business men playing serious ping pong. The fat man at the door had a manduan conversation with Daisuke and agreed to let us in. He greeted the man with the old ping pong phrase of good fortune “may the spin forever be in your favour”. I was very excited to see him play. Him and Burnie went to a free table and Myron looked handsomely across the table which was easy because it was at his eye level. He took out a little ball and hit it across the table with a little paddle. Burnie hit it back and Myron nodded his approval. The ball went back and forth, back and forth. It was so exciting I forgot all about the fact that we were in the middle of an active war zone on a downed airship with a heavily pregnant woman, and in need of finding magical artefacts of immense power in order to save the world from the tyranny of a terrible oppresive force. For now, watching people hitting a little ball back and forth was all that we needed. Riphard and I drank the warm sacky drink and clapped when appropriate (when Myron won!). Myron was keen for new challengers and a long haired greasy man seemed to be ready to be beaten by the gnome. Burnie leant close to Myrons ear and seemed to whisper him some advice. Myron seemed not to notice. Myron seemed to be playing the long game rather than the short long game, masterfully deceiving his component into a false sense of security by losing the first games. But then he became slightly ahead. The crowd didn’t look so happy at Myron’s lead. Finally Myron hit the ball so hard that the ball exploded onto the edge of the table and span away, the defeated opponent collapsing to his knees and weeping like a little human. Daisuke suggested we better leave because the people were too happy about Myron’s winning. Myron wanted more victory. Daisuke found him a new opponent, a young lean man with a red bandage around his head. Clearly he was wounded recently so it did not seem fair to put him against Myron. It was not even a challenge for Myron. Everyone got excited so we had to leave.    

    

We went back to the ship and I asked Rubrik’s Sensei to aid me in unlocking the secrets of the cube. He told me to believe in myself. I believed in myself so hard that I learned how to summon goats. The cube lifted into the air and started rotating all its sides around and I understood inside my head that the hammer was in Masuda. Myron let Daisuke know that we needed to head to Masuda and asked for advice. Daisuke said we would not even be allowed into Masuda because we were commons. Not even being diplohmats or lady harxmbes would not even be good enough. Burnie tried to make a plan about farms. Then there was a plan involving bribes that Daisuke daisuked much more. Daisuke suggested that we join a war family and maybe we could get in that way. Myron offered his thought on regicide which made a lot of sense. Then he made the point that maybe its better to sneak into a city than to take it by force with a whole army. Daisuke tells us we need to go roamin. Then we will be unaligned warriors with valour and actions. And we will need to prove ourselves. Confusing. I went to check on Delilah while Myron went to drink some seawater.    

    

Myron found me a little later on, and he said he wanted to tell me his idea. He was saying that he had an idea to put his thing in mine so it would make a big bang. I nearly fainted. When I started paying attention again and could feel my face I realised he was talking about putting gunpowder into my projectiles. It was a good idea indeed and I decided to try and make some over the night. I went to check on Kolo. He didn’t answer the door but slid out a couple of packages of ails’ya under the door. I hope he is okay. I checked in on Delilah too. Couldn’t hear the baby through her ankle. Guessing it’s coming soon. We should probably make sure we get some more towels in. The next morning we remembered that we didn’t really know what we were doing. More so than usual. Burnie asked Daisuke where all the headquarters were for all the people that we might decided to work for. Myron still had his doubts about attacking a city. Burnie asked how we can become roamin and we have to basically be heroic again. Myron once again voiced his concerns with the idea of insurgency. It did sound quite complicated when he laid it out in full. Burnie tried to be wise but it didn’t work because speaking and talking are the same thing. We discussed the pros and cons of becoming roamins. We decided after a lot of discussion that we would become roamins. Burnie asked about cigarettes and the lady king and Daisuke said that they had a lot in common but also not much in common and there was complications. Burnie’s belt is made from a monkey’s tail. Bold. I think we decided to be heroes. We sent Daisuke away to find us some heroic things to do. We went to visit our blacksmith friend again. He was much more animated this time. Myron had a bit of fun playing with the accent dial on my helmet but then went back to original. The man told us his name was bokedonk and he could sell us the black powder that we needed. We stocked up and I made the Myron Rounds and we went on our merry way.    

    

By the time we got back Daisuke had returned and found two potential fun activities for us to do. The first was a stronghold of orcs up to the east who are terrorsing the locals and need clearing out. The other is just to the north over the fields and far away where a lot of farms have been impacted by a creature called Raijyuu, the lightning beast. A fast runner to by all accounts, scorching the earth in its wake. Burnie suggested he wear rubber trousers to hide the urine which seemed wise for a man of his age. Myron knows all the ins and outs of defending farms. He thought the lightning creature might make lightning out of his glans. Burnie tried to ingragiate himself in front of us but we quickly put a stop to it. Those things are better behind closed doors. He took out a small chest and opened the complicated locking mechanism with three hands somehow. He pulled out some small items and gave them to us. Rippy got a whip that looked nice. Burnie called it the ‘whip of the roses’ which was form the arcanist man in the past and looks pretty sick. What a cool whip. I got a nice blueprint that looks like it is for a streamlined bullet that goes fast and can go through defenses. He got a bow for Kolo and put it by his door. He then pulled out a teapot and looked confused before passing it to Myron. Myron was already full of sea water so he politely declined. Apparently it had a secret spout and it was magical so it made poison. Myron decided he would have it and politely put it in the kitchen. I suggested he put a label on it to warn people that it had poison in it. Hoepfully that will ensure that there are no accidental drinkings. I was confused about the plan so Myron explained it again. Daisuke warned us to watch out for sanddaggers on the way which are very fast and you can’t run away from them. Lady Otoria always used to say these were bad too. With that happy thought, we set off on our journey to become noble roamins.    

    

Epilogue:    

    

Archibald had the uncanny feeling that he was being watched, and not for the first time that evening. The coldness of the harsh winter night was creeping in through the various cracks and broken windows that still needed to be fixed. Somewhere outside he heard the call of a bird, ringing out through the night. Long and drawn out, almost mournful. It made him shiver. He decided to finish up his evening checks a little quicker, the vault could wait until tomorrow. As he left the kitchen he noticed the back door was open, blowing in the wind and banging against its frame. He was sure it had been locked. He walked over, with trepidation, every sense heightened and every hair on the back of his neck standing on end. There it was again, that feeling of being watched. Turning around quickly he found himself alone. It was just his nerves, his old frayed nerves and nothing more. Although he wouldn’t admit it, he’d be glad when the new masters returned from their foreign travels. The roughians who had taken over the upper floors never talked to him and the building was far too big and lonely for one elderly man. He approached the door and went to grasp the handle, but as he reached for it he noticed the broken lock and the damage to the frame. The lights went out and he felt a movement behind him, fast and hard and heavy, a body leapt out at him and pushed him to the ground. He couldn’t move, a mixture of the stranger’s weight and his own shock forcing him into a state of panic. The mass reached out to him and turned him around. Against every instinct, Archibald opened his eyes and stared at the terror in front of him. Two impossibly large beady eyes, one black and one blood red stared at him, portraying a desperate wildness that offered a stark juxtaposition to the expressionless face that held them. A face that seemed to be half man, half bird and all torment. The creature that lay on him pressed down harder and lowered its disfigured beak to his ear.
