<p>The session opens with a fantastic poem that I am too slow at typing.</p>
<p>There is some confusion over Derek Bobacious’ name. But it’s definitely Bobacious with a B. None of that D shit.</p>
<p>Derek is drinking brandy. G’arbigail comes in after hunting.</p>
<p>G’abby talks about the small points of portmanteau.</p>
<p>G’Applesauce has a stupid name he’s trying to fix. He sucks by self admission.</p>
<p>Ghenri stands for things he doesnt know what they mean and berates Gappy</p>
<p>Gerald is there.</p>
<p>Mr GBonko is also there.</p>
<p>Derek says there’s a problem for the Gary guild. The guild of Chrismas exists. This is bad.</p>
<p>Gabby slams her hand on the table for funsies.</p>
<p>Derek says the Gary’s need a monopoly on name based guilds. He says that today is Chrismas Eve, making tomorrow Chrismas.</p>
<p>Gabby says giving gifts for free is to deny the right to earn it. Preventing them from their sense of pride and accomplishment.</p>
<p>Derek questions whether people like heroism more than free shit. People value leadership. Knowing theyre worth less than their betters.</p>
<p>Ghenri suggests poisoning the Chrismas guild.</p>
<p>Derek counts slowly and demands an end to Chrismas.</p>
<p>Derek suggests stopping present production and crashing the Jennys ball, making sure it is a disaster as it is Chrismas themed. We need to find out who the leader of Chrismas guild is and take them down.</p>
<p>GBonko is interested in the toys. His business was ruined by the devaluing of the toy market.</p>
<p>There is more discussion over whether pure free market capitalism or free toys makes society better.</p>
<p>Derek discusses why the most powerful Gary isn’t called Gary.</p>
<p>GEric is the lone person arguing for kindness and happiness for all. Disgusting.</p>
<p>Derek suggests unconvincingly less murdering is better for the Garys image.</p>
<p>GBonko asks for some secret payment from Derek who graciously obliges.</p>
<p>Gabby wants to hand out pamplets questioning what the purpose of the Garys is. Seriously. What is it? We want to know.</p>
<p>GBonko spouts some anti Gary shit. GHenri questions why he’s even here. Gabby says we should leave rather than listen to GBonko.</p>
<p>GBonko blames the orcs for the downfall of his business.</p>
<p>Cut to a warehouse. Bustling toy-making noises emanate from within. It’s in a basement with 1 entrance. Fire regulations beings ignored clearly.</p>
<p>Geric knocks on the door, and a rude man answers through a shutter.</p>
<p>Geric explains we’re here from the Gary guild, but Gabby talks smack and says we’re here to fuck them up.</p>
<p>Geric says we just want to talk about Chrismas.</p>
<p>Ghenri tries the old inspector routine to no avail.</p>
<p>Geric gets frustrated at the rude door man and gobby Gabby. GBonko still questions who Gary is.</p>
<p>Ghenri readies a fire arrow. GBonko pours a questionable liquid onto the arrow in attempt to put it out.</p>
<p>Geric and Gappy knock on the door again. The rude man answers again, ignoring Geric.</p>
<p>Gappy pretends to be Crapplesauce and gets us in the door.</p>
<p>Geric puts the roof fire out, but still makes it through the door. With no rolling at all. Disappointing.</p>
<p>The warehouse map uses Papyrus font. Nice.</p>
<p>The warehouse is full of robots singing an annoying christmas song.</p>
<p>The rude man is revealed as Chris Tingle. GBonko inspects his face for orcish features.</p>
<p>Crappy addresses Chris. He asks if he’s the real Chris. “We’re all Chrises”. “But are you THE chris”. “No Im just Chris.” Crappy stabslashes Chris. GBonko is incredulous at the stlashing. Geric tries to disarm Crappy. A Crappy sword flies from his hands as Geric shoves Crappy away from Chris.</p>
<p>Geric berates Crappy saying he’s out of control.</p>
<p>Chris instructs the robots to kill, who start singing a jolly murder song.</p>
<p>The robots mostly attack GBonko. They miss Ghenri. They attempt to wrap GBonko in wrapping paper. A robot watches Gabby fire pissing. Gabby flails wildly in response, twatting the robot and running away.</p>
<p>Ghenri stabs a bitch.</p>
<p>Chris whips at Geric. An amazing verbal sparring occurs between Chris and Geric.</p>
<p>GBonko reflects on his poor life choices and bitch wife. He retreats behind some nearby crates and starts continues to drink.</p>
<p>Ghenri continues his stabathon and grabs a chunk of robot wiring.</p>
<p>Crappy picks up his sword and stabby stabs a robot.</p>
<p>Geric once again turncoats and tries to sleeper hold Ghenri, but panics at the last minute and bolts from the warehouse.</p>
<p>Ghenri gets wrapped up good. With a bow. And hammered.</p>
<p>Gbonko and Gabby also get hammered. Apt for Gbonko.</p>
<p>Gabby flails repeatedly. It’s pretty effective. Except when it isn’t.</p>
<p>Chris whips Crappy.</p>
<p>Gbonko drinks more and has PTSD flashbacks about why he hates orc so much. It’s because of his father I think. His wife slept with a lathe? He pulls out a giant hammer. Too little too late? The robot doesn’t die despite some great alcohol fuelled hits. Everyone listens to sad Carol of the Bells.</p>
<p>Ghenri bursts out of the wrapping paper and attempts to jump onto the crates. He’s struck twice in the air and goes limp, but just before he lands jolts back to life with a second wind.</p>
<p>Geric is looking for the police but hasnt found them in the ensuing 6 seconds. He tries instead to clothesline Crapple unsuccessfully, who has also tried to run away it seems. Probably sensible.</p>
<p>The robots continue their murder spree. One manages to gracefully follow Ghenri onto the boxes, but drops his hammer in the process into the box gaps. Gbonko laughs at the pathetic toy robot hammers.</p>
<p>Crapple tries to do something but the context is lost in meta discussion. It seems fine.</p>
<p>Gabby rifles through her pockets for flammable materials finding the pamphlets. She drops some smoldering tinder into some nearby boxes as she darts away from the bots.</p>
<p>Chris takes on Gbonko, whipping in his drunk face.</p>
<p>Gbonko thinks Chris thinks he’s better than him and finally kills one of the robots.</p>
<p>Ghenri jumps away from the bots and looses a fire arrow at Chris, but misses, instead sending some boxes ablaze.</p>
<p>Crapple cries out to nearby Chrismas revellers for help while courageously sprinting away. They oblige in providing assistance, letting him know where a nearby sawbones lies.</p>
<p>Geric follows the revellers to the police station.</p>
<p>The robots huddle in the middle of the factory. Probably conspiring to form a union. Another unsuccessfully wraps Gbonko.</p>
<p>Gabby continues her full lap around the factory, but clumsily smacks into a box, setting it aflame.</p>
<p>Chris whips Gbonko, who feels the old familiar sting. He still hurts.</p>
<p>Gbonko channels the rage into a reckless attack on the robot before him, smashing it to pieces. He drinks its oil, spitting it onto the fire, then vomits.</p>
<p>Gbonko pleads with Chris to leave this damn burning factory. As he does, a flaming arrow bursts through Chris’ cranium. As he crumples to the floor, Gbonko tearfully holds Chris’ limp body in his arms, offering him help.</p>
<p>Gabby tells Gbonko, and especially Ghenri, that they could one day be Garys.</p>
<p>Geric and firefighters arrive as they are leaving. Gabby tries to blame pedophiles, and Geric in particular. The firemen tell Geric that he’s in dodgy ground, but looking at the teenage Gabby, ephibophilia isnt pedophilia, and promptly leave, not wanting to get involved. Everyone is concerned by this response to serious sexual assault allegations in the current climate.</p>
<p>Gbonko wants to get paid and get (more) drunk. Gabby reassures him that after a hard days Garying they will get drunk.</p>
<p>Everyones rests and heals up. They head back to Bobacious.</p>
<p>The group explain what happened at the factory to Derek, Gabby explaining that Geric was exposed as a pedophile. Derek is relieved to hear that at least the factory was burnt down as desired.</p>
<p>The group reflects on their lost comrade and their own actions, but agree that they must press on FOR GARY. It is also pointed out that ultimately Geric tried to get the authorities involved, and snitches get stitches.</p>
<p>Derek tell the group to crash the Jennys Ball and make sure it’s terrible, but with no violence.</p>
<p>Gbonko feels shaken and nervous about the ball, and inquiries as to if he has anything that could help with that. He is handed a bottle of “cough syrup”. Derek tells the group to get dressed up.</p>
<p>Ghenri knows a poisoneer, and not the fish kind (he’s French. GET IT?).</p>
<p>The group head to the ball.</p>
<p>Gapple reminisces about all his favourite apple based holidays, lamenting these newfangled Chris based shenanigans.</p>
<p>A crooner singing festive hits is on the stage. Chris Martin. It’s populist, but dull.</p>
<p>There are 3 guards around from the Jennys guild and the thieves guild, known as the three Ho’s.</p>
<p>Ghenri scopes out the kitchen and asks to compliments the chefs. The waiters lead Ghenri back to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Gapple creepily talks to the security Jennys, asking if they’re after any mercenary work. They explain that everyone here is a violent killer so they’re not really needed, they’re there more for diplomacy.</p>
<p>Gabby looks around skeptically, worrying that she could easily be persuaded into being a Jenny being the young, impressionable whore she is.</p>
<p>Derek Bobacious is there and spots Gabby. Gabby berates Derek for being at the ball at all, warning him of the Jennys pleasure. Derek is up for seductive pleasure, being “immune” to their charm.</p>
<p>The chef takes Ghenris compliments poorly, refusing to give up his recipe, but Ghenri just wants to talk cooking being from the famous for its cuisine city of Jecede.</p>
<p>GBonko asks if the most approachable person wants a drink. He talks about shitting on people. “I’ve heard people pay good money for that” “Yeah, fucking Orcs!”. GBonko is very cynical and angry at the fancy ball, stating that it’s nothing but shit and slaves. He’s trying to ruin the party by making people miserable. Unforunately he’s far too charismatic, finding his deep philosophical learnings grossly interesting, inspiring them to forget the woes of society he espouses by drinking, dancing, and revelling. He tries to vomit to make up for his excessive charm, but his iron stomach after years of heavy regret drinking, means he is incapable. He resigns to being the life of the party.</p>
<p>Gabby continues to look for clues and ins, but she’s starting to become obsessed with the singer, Chris Martin.</p>
<p>Gapple notices one other guard in red. Big and hench. Hunky. Big white beard. Phwoar. He introduces himself as Chris Mas. He’s there to tell them all about the Chris’ special bulking regimen, saying they can all learn to be swole like him, and how the Chris’ are dedicated to making everyones lives better. Awful.</p>
<p>Gapple says he’s a Jennys pleasure boy, and says he’s here at Chris Mas’ service. Chris Mas looks him up and down. “You’re not my type. Too small” Gapple is deeply offended.</p>
<p>Ghenri has engaged the chef in conversation, and tries to poison the food, but the chef clearly sees him mid poison. Ghenri tells him he’s actually a terrible chef, and that he didnt want to hurt his feelings, so was trying to secretly improve the food while also sharing his knowledge to help him improve as a chef. The chef bursts into tears and asks to try the poisoned food. Ghenri convinces him that he is not worthy of this fine cuisine, and he should go home and reconsider his career as a chef.</p>
<p>Gabby did some stuff I didnt hear while I typed the above.</p>
<p>GBonko gets out an acoustic guitar and tries to play badly on stage, singing off key and playing annoying scales. It’s very mediocre, which of course is worse than both good and very bad music.</p>
<p>Gabby sounds fucking wasted, trying to convince Chris Martin they have to get really wasted? She wants to sing a song. GBonko pushes Chris Martin off the stage, and tells GBonko to hit it. GBonko starts to play Classical Gassy Orcs. Gabby sings Wonderwall. GBonko starts playing guitar percussion. It’s really really bad. BOOOOOO</p>
<p>The poisoned food comes out ready. Appalled by the performance, everyone rushes to the buffet and stuffs their faces.</p>
<p>Gapplesauce joins in the performance. Everyone starts screaming. The guests have started bleeding out of their eyes. Gapple asks Chris Mas from the stage about the “real Chris”, pressing him for the HQ location. Chris is no chump, and ain’t giving up shit. Especially as everyone is currently bleeding out of their eyes. He storms out, but conveniently drops a letter behind him.</p>
<p>Derek is very happy about the terrible party. It’s gone midnight and Gabby worries about her parents reaction to the late night. Derek reads the mysterious Chris letter.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow Chris Mas day will happen. Make sure everyone has a good time so the plan will happen. A. B.”</p>
<p>Derek turns Scottish with anger. It’s a phrase. He tells everyone to return to the Gary guild tomorrow to finish this.</p>
<p>The group arrive at the Gary guild. Gabby feels rough. GBonko hasn’t shown up.</p>
<p>“Today we ruin Chris Mas once and for all!” says Derek. Derek leads the group to an unassuming house. Gabby flails at the door. Gapple snaps his lock pick in the lock. Gabby continues slapping at the door, smashing it open. GBonko stumbles upon the house. “Hey! Itsh, shyou guysh. I think?”</p>
<p>The group blindly enter the house and begin rooting through the drawers. Gabby happens to move the drawers in the drawers finding a secret switch, opening a secret passageway.</p>
<p>Gabby hears some clucking from the passage and heads down. The group are attacked by 2 rafters (swarms) of gobbling turkeys. The group fight back obviously, and probably win easily. It’s not a classic fight or anything. The details don’t matter much, but GBonko drinks cough syrup, Gabby runs away a bit, the turkeys have chicken rabies, which Gapple contracts and will probably die in 6-8 weeks, Gabby also gets chicken aids. Ghenri garlic arrows the turkeys, making them tastier. Gapple stabs em up as usual, dicing up the garlicy turkeys. Gabby flails at the rabid pecking turkeys remaining while running further away and holding a door shut to keep the turkeys out, but the turkeys burst the door down against her measly strength. GBonko drinks. Gabby finally murders the last of the turkeys.</p>
<p>Gabby coughs up turkey aids blood and feathers. GBonko pisses on Bobacious unimpressively. Derek mocks GBonko’s pathetic penis. GBonko passes out, but conveniently wakes back up with a promise of an ending very soon for this ridiculous one shot adventure.</p>
<p>Bobacious enters the final room. “Goddamit, I knew it was you”. A blonde woman and older man stand before him. “Oh hello father”. It’s Amelia Bobacious! DUNDUNDUN. Josh is impressed with this deep deep reference. The other man says “Oh hello father.” “No, you’re not my son! You’re my son in law!” Harsh.</p>
<p>There’s some family back and forth about guilds and stuff. Amelia explains her business to Derek. Derek questions how she’s making money off giving away free toys. “Quith” explains that everyone receiving a present or gift today has actually signed an agreement stating they will owe the Chris guild lots of money, they just didn’t read the small print. Dastards. “But people will never pay such a hidden agreement!” shouts Derek incredulously.</p>
<p>Derek demands Amelia divorce Quith and stop this nonsence. Amelia presses a button opening a secret door revealing MegaMechaSantaClaus. “I believe this Claus will be able to uphold the contract clause”. Everyone groans and bays for blood and/or Santa oil.</p>
<p>Gapple stabs Quith in the heart, who lays dying. Amelia pleads with Derek to spare Quith. Mechasanta anticlimactically explodes on his own. Ghenri stands in confusion, unsure what to do. The group stand down in deference to Derek.</p>
<p>Amelia and Derek make up over Quith’s dying body, with Amelia agreeing to give up the guild to spare Quith. At this moment, Ghenri accidentally looses an arrow, which ricochets off several walls before killing Quith instantly. He awkwardly walks backwards out of the room. “Well, I guess that’s the meaning of QuithMas.”</p>
<p>Roll credits.</p>
<p>Epilogue: Gabby and Gapple both die of chicken aids. GBonko succumbs to his alcoholism, leaving behind a widow and some children who probably starve to death. Geric becomes a police officer, but is brutally cut down in the field of duty by a mysteriously angry group of children. The case remains unsolved. Ghenri decided to follow his first passion and opened a cookery school, but was brutally murdered by what was assumed to be a jilted former student unhappy at Ghenri’s harsh teaching methods. Scribbled on the walls in Ghenri’s blood at the crime scene were the words “YOU’RE ONTRAYS ARE SHIT”.</p>

    <textarea readonly class="source" rows="20" cols="20">#Episode 33.75: Bobacious Takes On Chrismas    
The session opens with a fantastic poem that I am too slow at typing.
    
There is some confusion over Derek Bobacious’ name. But it’s definitely Bobacious with a B. None of that D shit.
    
Derek is drinking brandy. G’arbigail comes in after hunting.
    
G’abby talks about the small points of portmanteau.
    
G’Applesauce has a stupid name he’s trying to fix. He sucks by self admission.
    
Ghenri stands for things he doesnt know what they mean and berates Gappy
    
Gerald is there.
    
Mr GBonko is also there.
    
Derek says there’s a problem for the Gary guild. The guild of Chrismas exists. This is bad.
    
Gabby slams her hand on the table for funsies.
    
Derek says the Gary’s need a monopoly on name based guilds. He says that today is Chrismas Eve, making tomorrow Chrismas.
    
Gabby says giving gifts for free is to deny the right to earn it. Preventing them from their sense of pride and accomplishment.
    
Derek questions whether people like heroism more than free shit. People value leadership. Knowing theyre worth less than their betters.
    
Ghenri suggests poisoning the Chrismas guild.
    
Derek counts slowly and demands an end to Chrismas.
    
Derek suggests stopping present production and crashing the Jennys ball, making sure it is a disaster as it is Chrismas themed. We need to find out who the leader of Chrismas guild is and take them down.
    
GBonko is interested in the toys. His business was ruined by the devaluing of the toy market.
    
There is more discussion over whether pure free market capitalism or free toys makes society better.
    
Derek discusses why the most powerful Gary isn’t called Gary.
    
GEric is the lone person arguing for kindness and happiness for all. Disgusting.
    
Derek suggests unconvincingly less murdering is better for the Garys image.
    
GBonko asks for some secret payment from Derek who graciously obliges.
    
Gabby wants to hand out pamplets questioning what the purpose of the Garys is. Seriously. What is it? We want to know.
    
GBonko spouts some anti Gary shit. GHenri questions why he’s even here. Gabby says we should leave rather than listen to GBonko.
    
GBonko blames the orcs for the downfall of his business.
    
Cut to a warehouse. Bustling toy-making noises emanate from within. It’s in a basement with 1 entrance. Fire regulations beings ignored clearly.
    
Geric knocks on the door, and a rude man answers through a shutter.
    
Geric explains we’re here from the Gary guild, but Gabby talks smack and says we’re here to fuck them up.
    
Geric says we just want to talk about Chrismas.
    
Ghenri tries the old inspector routine to no avail.
    
Geric gets frustrated at the rude door man and gobby Gabby. GBonko still questions who Gary is.
    
Ghenri readies a fire arrow. GBonko pours a questionable liquid onto the arrow in attempt to put it out.
    
Geric and Gappy knock on the door again. The rude man answers again, ignoring Geric.
    
Gappy pretends to be Crapplesauce and gets us in the door.
    
Geric puts the roof fire out, but still makes it through the door. With no rolling at all. Disappointing.
    
The warehouse map uses Papyrus font. Nice.
    
The warehouse is full of robots singing an annoying christmas song.
    
The rude man is revealed as Chris Tingle. GBonko inspects his face for orcish features.
    
Crappy addresses Chris. He asks if he’s the real Chris. “We’re all Chrises”. “But are you THE chris”. “No Im just Chris.” Crappy stabslashes Chris. GBonko is incredulous at the stlashing. Geric tries to disarm Crappy. A Crappy sword flies from his hands as Geric shoves Crappy away from Chris.
    
Geric berates Crappy saying he’s out of control.
    
Chris instructs the robots to kill, who start singing a jolly murder song.
    
The robots mostly attack GBonko. They miss Ghenri. They attempt to wrap GBonko in wrapping paper. A robot watches Gabby fire pissing. Gabby flails wildly in response, twatting the robot and running away.
    
Ghenri stabs a bitch.
    
Chris whips at Geric. An amazing verbal sparring occurs between Chris and Geric.
    
GBonko reflects on his poor life choices and bitch wife. He retreats behind some nearby crates and starts continues to drink.
    
Ghenri continues his stabathon and grabs a chunk of robot wiring.
    
Crappy picks up his sword and stabby stabs a robot.
    
Geric once again turncoats and tries to sleeper hold Ghenri, but panics at the last minute and bolts from the warehouse.
    
Ghenri gets wrapped up good. With a bow. And hammered.
    
Gbonko and Gabby also get hammered. Apt for Gbonko.
    
Gabby flails repeatedly. It’s pretty effective. Except when it isn’t.
    
Chris whips Crappy.
    
Gbonko drinks more and has PTSD flashbacks about why he hates orc so much. It’s because of his father I think. His wife slept with a lathe? He pulls out a giant hammer. Too little too late? The robot doesn’t die despite some great alcohol fuelled hits. Everyone listens to sad Carol of the Bells.
    
Ghenri bursts out of the wrapping paper and attempts to jump onto the crates. He’s struck twice in the air and goes limp, but just before he lands jolts back to life with a second wind.
    
Geric is looking for the police but hasnt found them in the ensuing 6 seconds. He tries instead to clothesline Crapple unsuccessfully, who has also tried to run away it seems. Probably sensible.
    
The robots continue their murder spree. One manages to gracefully follow Ghenri onto the boxes, but drops his hammer in the process into the box gaps. Gbonko laughs at the pathetic toy robot hammers.
    
Crapple tries to do something but the context is lost in meta discussion. It seems fine.
    
Gabby rifles through her pockets for flammable materials finding the pamphlets. She drops some smoldering tinder into some nearby boxes as she darts away from the bots.
    
Chris takes on Gbonko, whipping in his drunk face.
    
Gbonko thinks Chris thinks he’s better than him and finally kills one of the robots.
    
Ghenri jumps away from the bots and looses a fire arrow at Chris, but misses, instead sending some boxes ablaze.
    
Crapple cries out to nearby Chrismas revellers for help while courageously sprinting away. They oblige in providing assistance, letting him know where a nearby sawbones lies.
    
Geric follows the revellers to the police station.
    
The robots huddle in the middle of the factory. Probably conspiring to form a union. Another unsuccessfully wraps Gbonko.
    
Gabby continues her full lap around the factory, but clumsily smacks into a box, setting it aflame.
    
Chris whips Gbonko, who feels the old familiar sting. He still hurts.
    
Gbonko channels the rage into a reckless attack on the robot before him, smashing it to pieces. He drinks its oil, spitting it onto the fire, then vomits.
    
Gbonko pleads with Chris to leave this damn burning factory. As he does, a flaming arrow bursts through Chris’ cranium. As he crumples to the floor, Gbonko tearfully holds Chris’ limp body in his arms, offering him help.
    
Gabby tells Gbonko, and especially Ghenri, that they could one day be Garys.
    
Geric and firefighters arrive as they are leaving. Gabby tries to blame pedophiles, and Geric in particular. The firemen tell Geric that he’s in dodgy ground, but looking at the teenage Gabby, ephibophilia isnt pedophilia, and promptly leave, not wanting to get involved. Everyone is concerned by this response to serious sexual assault allegations in the current climate.
    
Gbonko wants to get paid and get (more) drunk. Gabby reassures him that after a hard days Garying they will get drunk.
    
Everyones rests and heals up. They head back to Bobacious.
    
The group explain what happened at the factory to Derek, Gabby explaining that Geric was exposed as a pedophile. Derek is relieved to hear that at least the factory was burnt down as desired.
    
The group reflects on their lost comrade and their own actions, but agree that they must press on FOR GARY. It is also pointed out that ultimately Geric tried to get the authorities involved, and snitches get stitches.
    
Derek tell the group to crash the Jennys Ball and make sure it’s terrible, but with no violence.
    
Gbonko feels shaken and nervous about the ball, and inquiries as to if he has anything that could help with that. He is handed a bottle of “cough syrup”. Derek tells the group to get dressed up.
    
Ghenri knows a poisoneer, and not the fish kind (he’s French. GET IT?).
    
The group head to the ball.
    
Gapple reminisces about all his favourite apple based holidays, lamenting these newfangled Chris based shenanigans.
    
A crooner singing festive hits is on the stage. Chris Martin. It’s populist, but dull.
    
There are 3 guards around from the Jennys guild and the thieves guild, known as the three Ho’s.
    
Ghenri scopes out the kitchen and asks to compliments the chefs. The waiters lead Ghenri back to the kitchen.
    
Gapple creepily talks to the security Jennys, asking if they’re after any mercenary work. They explain that everyone here is a violent killer so they’re not really needed, they’re there more for diplomacy.
    
Gabby looks around skeptically, worrying that she could easily be persuaded into being a Jenny being the young, impressionable whore she is.
    
Derek Bobacious is there and spots Gabby. Gabby berates Derek for being at the ball at all, warning him of the Jennys pleasure. Derek is up for seductive pleasure, being “immune” to their charm.
    
The chef takes Ghenris compliments poorly, refusing to give up his recipe, but Ghenri just wants to talk cooking being from the famous for its cuisine city of Jecede.
    
GBonko asks if the most approachable person wants a drink. He talks about shitting on people. “I’ve heard people pay good money for that” “Yeah, fucking Orcs!”. GBonko is very cynical and angry at the fancy ball, stating that it’s nothing but shit and slaves. He’s trying to ruin the party by making people miserable. Unforunately he’s far too charismatic, finding his deep philosophical learnings grossly interesting, inspiring them to forget the woes of society he espouses by drinking, dancing, and revelling. He tries to vomit to make up for his excessive charm, but his iron stomach after years of heavy regret drinking, means he is incapable. He resigns to being the life of the party.
    
Gabby continues to look for clues and ins, but she’s starting to become obsessed with the singer, Chris Martin.
    
Gapple notices one other guard in red. Big and hench. Hunky. Big white beard. Phwoar. He introduces himself as Chris Mas. He’s there to tell them all about the Chris’ special bulking regimen, saying they can all learn to be swole like him, and how the Chris’ are dedicated to making everyones lives better. Awful.
    
Gapple says he’s a Jennys pleasure boy, and says he’s here at Chris Mas’ service. Chris Mas looks him up and down. “You’re not my type. Too small” Gapple is deeply offended.
    
Ghenri has engaged the chef in conversation, and tries to poison the food, but the chef clearly sees him mid poison. Ghenri tells him he’s actually a terrible chef, and that he didnt want to hurt his feelings, so was trying to secretly improve the food while also sharing his knowledge to help him improve as a chef. The chef bursts into tears and asks to try the poisoned food. Ghenri convinces him that he is not worthy of this fine cuisine, and he should go home and reconsider his career as a chef.
    
Gabby did some stuff I didnt hear while I typed the above.
    
GBonko gets out an acoustic guitar and tries to play badly on stage, singing off key and playing annoying scales. It’s very mediocre, which of course is worse than both good and very bad music.
    
Gabby sounds fucking wasted, trying to convince Chris Martin they have to get really wasted? She wants to sing a song. GBonko pushes Chris Martin off the stage, and tells GBonko to hit it. GBonko starts to play Classical Gassy Orcs. Gabby sings Wonderwall. GBonko starts playing guitar percussion. It’s really really bad. BOOOOOO
    
The poisoned food comes out ready. Appalled by the performance, everyone rushes to the buffet and stuffs their faces.
    
Gapplesauce joins in the performance. Everyone starts screaming. The guests have started bleeding out of their eyes. Gapple asks Chris Mas from the stage about the “real Chris”, pressing him for the HQ location. Chris is no chump, and ain’t giving up shit. Especially as everyone is currently bleeding out of their eyes. He storms out, but conveniently drops a letter behind him.
    
Derek is very happy about the terrible party. It’s gone midnight and Gabby worries about her parents reaction to the late night. Derek reads the mysterious Chris letter.
    
“Tomorrow Chris Mas day will happen. Make sure everyone has a good time so the plan will happen. A. B.”
    
Derek turns Scottish with anger. It’s a phrase. He tells everyone to return to the Gary guild tomorrow to finish this.
    
The group arrive at the Gary guild. Gabby feels rough. GBonko hasn’t shown up.
    
“Today we ruin Chris Mas once and for all!” says Derek. Derek leads the group to an unassuming house. Gabby flails at the door. Gapple snaps his lock pick in the lock. Gabby continues slapping at the door, smashing it open. GBonko stumbles upon the house. “Hey! Itsh, shyou guysh. I think?”
    
The group blindly enter the house and begin rooting through the drawers. Gabby happens to move the drawers in the drawers finding a secret switch, opening a secret passageway.
    
Gabby hears some clucking from the passage and heads down. The group are attacked by 2 rafters (swarms) of gobbling turkeys. The group fight back obviously, and probably win easily. It’s not a classic fight or anything. The details don’t matter much, but GBonko drinks cough syrup, Gabby runs away a bit, the turkeys have chicken rabies, which Gapple contracts and will probably die in 6-8 weeks, Gabby also gets chicken aids. Ghenri garlic arrows the turkeys, making them tastier. Gapple stabs em up as usual, dicing up the garlicy turkeys. Gabby flails at the rabid pecking turkeys remaining while running further away and holding a door shut to keep the turkeys out, but the turkeys burst the door down against her measly strength. GBonko drinks. Gabby finally murders the last of the turkeys.
    
Gabby coughs up turkey aids blood and feathers. GBonko pisses on Bobacious unimpressively. Derek mocks GBonko’s pathetic penis. GBonko passes out, but conveniently wakes back up with a promise of an ending very soon for this ridiculous one shot adventure.
    
Bobacious enters the final room. “Goddamit, I knew it was you”. A blonde woman and older man stand before him. “Oh hello father”. It’s Amelia Bobacious! DUNDUNDUN. Josh is impressed with this deep deep reference. The other man says “Oh hello father.” “No, you’re not my son! You’re my son in law!” Harsh.
    
There’s some family back and forth about guilds and stuff. Amelia explains her business to Derek. Derek questions how she’s making money off giving away free toys. “Quith” explains that everyone receiving a present or gift today has actually signed an agreement stating they will owe the Chris guild lots of money, they just didn’t read the small print. Dastards. “But people will never pay such a hidden agreement!” shouts Derek incredulously.
    
Derek demands Amelia divorce Quith and stop this nonsence. Amelia presses a button opening a secret door revealing MegaMechaSantaClaus. “I believe this Claus will be able to uphold the contract clause”. Everyone groans and bays for blood and/or Santa oil.
    
Gapple stabs Quith in the heart, who lays dying. Amelia pleads with Derek to spare Quith. Mechasanta anticlimactically explodes on his own. Ghenri stands in confusion, unsure what to do. The group stand down in deference to Derek.
    
Amelia and Derek make up over Quith’s dying body, with Amelia agreeing to give up the guild to spare Quith. At this moment, Ghenri accidentally looses an arrow, which ricochets off several walls before killing Quith instantly. He awkwardly walks backwards out of the room. “Well, I guess that’s the meaning of QuithMas.”
    
Roll credits.
    
Epilogue: Gabby and Gapple both die of chicken aids. GBonko succumbs to his alcoholism, leaving behind a widow and some children who probably starve to death. Geric becomes a police officer, but is brutally cut down in the field of duty by a mysteriously angry group of children. The case remains unsolved.
