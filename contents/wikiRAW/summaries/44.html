<p>Well, Kolo got Stanri killed last week but he did his job and protected Kolo so I guess alls is wells that ends wells. I was gonna rebuild him anyway with some new secret plans that I have made up in my head anyway so it is not even that much of a problem. His metal brain is still in one piece so we won’t lose any data. I managed to cobble together a couple of new tricksy trick things from his scraps to help us in the dungeon to make up for the lack of claws and teeth.</p>
<p>After the excitenment of last week we decided we were going to have a little restsies and took over the lovely camp. I stayed up to watch out wih Kolo but I was ever so tired and I could feel my gabrin eyes getting heaveer and heaveer. BUT THEN Kolo shouted out that something was coming. Kolo was straight into action and fired a bow and/or arrow at it. He was shoked by the extra surprise that his bow was able to extra surprise the creature that at that point none of us could even see. Myron tensed his muscles and got ready so I got ready too. Riphard went to take a look and was all like “bloody hell” and did a shot. I don’t know what came over him but for once his shooting was top notch. It’s lyke he was a new man almost. The monstaer came ito the room and me and myron did our shots and shot it good. The perfect couple ;) It looked horrid and was like a big white thing with horns and did roors of angerand ice came out of its mouth everywhere. Kolo went down immediately. Bernee ran to help him up and told me to kill the thing. A big ask. Myron was all vcovered in snow like a snowman and triedd to kill the thing but his gun was all full of snow. I was inspired and shot the thing and i was so furious and then i threw the mideicne to bernie to give to kolo but i was also really neervous about him and then rippy was touching himself and then he was smiting the thunder everywehre. The big creature looked down at myron and then myron stopped moving, cold as ice. Bernie dragged kolo back to the fire and give him the medicine and then hes better and walkingabut again. Kolo was straightback into his bowing and he was furious of the small. Myron looked back at the monster and suddenly his coak like snapped and all the ice just like flew off him amazing. I told kolo to get back to me and I shot the thing and shot it so hard because bernie and it’s head explaoded. I helpled kolo with the elctircity to make him feel good. Riphard went to myron and helped him get more feeling better. Our mouths dropped. Since when coud riphard even do this?? It was amazing.</p>
<p>Kolo and I went to work and kolo cstrated cutting it all up while i ran a little scane. It was so much quicker when i could use stanri to do the scans. I made a couple of armors for peopel and gave it to kolo and myron. Burnie asked about my shakey device. How could he know about this????????? I literally only invented it today and have neve reven used it. Kolo tried to pickpoket the files tha burniee is always hiding. He said it just had a middlee fingger picture in it. Why is he studying fingers???? Tricksy.</p>
<p>Myron did another talk to us to motivate us abotu not dygin. Burnie tooko the monster skinss. He also put his fist into the wargg and put some snow monsterer meat into its bottom. Myron took the kokokola. I hope its still goood after all theat time at th ebottom of bagsy. Kolo had one too and they gave eachtoher a shared look, a knowing look of shared experience. That look still haunts me….</p>
<p>Senpai and kolo led the way down the corridor where the snow monsetr was. Kolo and myron were acting a bit odd. We went into a big room that was “decidedly empty”. Just fire and hooks and a pen. Kolo ran into a little house screaming giddily abuot the magic house. The war drums wer still banging and they were much closer now. Much closer. Bernie otok a moment to apprecaite the arkitectuer. Myron called a huddle. He said the ackshun was donw the slope and offeredn us too ways to go: cut off the head of the fish and see whats inside, aor not go there and go and see the others to see if anyone was going to bother us while we were bothering them. Kolo found more houses. Myorn said “look look look look look look”. And then he said we were going through the little one but all sneaky. Something is not right with these two. Myron ran back to get his pack which he lefat by the fire and took a moment to appreshiate the scent of burneis meal cooking.</p>
<p>We passed through a narrow sseries f ocracks in the walls. Burnei was checking for traps after we had already walked through everywhere. After some crawling we could finally see fire in the disatnce. I left the boys to talk about tortoises and sneaked forwadr to see what was going on. It lokoed liek a celebration and there wer two big orcs there and there were loads of orcs. Oh god myrona nd kolo were being so loud. I checked bagsy and found kolos clear liquid and his speed powder. I thought carefully and decided to give them to kolo. He knows best I am 110% sure. 110%.......</p>
<p>Kolo was the first to act. Of course he was. He sneaked off into a hut and awalked like a tortoise there, and then he was pretending to be what looked like a sausage rolling along the roof. It looked like he was trying to get the hookah pipe. I told him to put on his armor but it looked like there awas a problem. I heard the “wwhummmmp” from where I was and so did the orcs. It was on. Kolo sprang to action faster than bernie. “TORTOISE TO ME” he said huffing the white powder like a champ. A champ who knew no fear at alll. He started to swell up all over, his little gabrin face and arms swelling up. Bernie said he heard somethign about them celebreating the blessings of kalimar. Kolo came back to us. Bernie took a flask of oil and put a hole in it and then didn’t. He stepped forward breavely shielding kolo and gave us a smile and raised his sword. The big boys ran at him. He headbutted them really hard. It was cool and the first one just dropped like a pigeon. Myron looked at me and he said “stay here stay safe, no matter what happens ill get your borther out”. So hot. So so hot. He just jumped and crashed down and started shooting like a boss. Rip is here too we remember. Myron put kolo on his shoulders and kolo started singing his swollen song “goblin turtle ninja power”. I told rippy we needed his help and killed an orc. The biggest boy walked through the flames and shouted out “kill them for kalifar” in a very scary way and he made the orcs attack. THey couldnt even hti them hahahaha. Rippy stepped up and hesitated and thought and then he blessed his bullet sand even killed it (he was being so good today) and then what he then did was he reloaded really fast and then he shot another orc and he killed aother one. This is amzing. I was in awe. I think we all were. We never knew he was capable of this. “I hate these green slimy bastards….and the orcs”. I was not even mad. Kolo was on it too “TURTLE POWR!!!” and just destroye danother orc. Bernie found himself feeling very aloen at the fornt of the battle. Myron ran up to help him as he got hit lots and just went mental with his gun pacifier and the orog didnt look so smug anymoroe he didnt and was bleeding heavily. Bernie was all like “you aint working for kalimor we are” which didnt make sense but then he fainted and then he sworded them more and then he dodged randomly. I loaded in a myron bullet and waited. I waited and waited, steadyyyyy steadddyyyy and then the big guy came close enough and i shot that fire hell at him and his friends. One orc just exploded and the other orogs looked bad. The big guy just kept goingg!!! And he was going towards myron !!! Rippy stepped up again and was so nonchalant. He just shot an orc without killing it, regressing to the mean. KOLO DIVED IN “TURRRRTLEEE POOOWEEERRRR” aiming his knives at their ballsakcs. BOth died, clutching their uselss testicles, wondering where they had gone so wrong in their lives. Kolo wore them like puppets. Horrible testicle puppets. Bernie fainted and attacked the little orc and then it was nt alive anymore. He let out a rather lame “totem power” missing the point completely once again. Myron threw his bayonet into him and i tried to shot him but bernies voice annoyed me and i was worried about hitting myron. Why does he think kolo would be sayign “totem power”?? Rippy had another go but regressed to the mean even more. Kolo kept screaming about turtles tat burnie while he rolled around on his knees trying to hit the big man but he couldnt because of the outrage. Bernie shouted “time to end this” and I laughed. Against all odds he actually killed the big man. Just like that. I could not even believe we survived that. We were so surrounded. Epic</p>
<p>We didn’t even have any time to rest, kolo just ran off faster than we could catch him. He came into a large room and another load of orcs and a big orc and wargs and the big orc had red paint on his face and he was talking to the others. The big orc was looking at a big hole in the ground, and he puleld ouap the handfuls of the red stuff and but it on his face. Bernie sadi it lokoed like a blood orgy and he had been to a few. I don’t know what an orgy is. Myron grabbed kol and told hi they were turtlel buddies anf that they had tomaximiese their turtlel power by coming back and then we could make a bottole neck to attackk. Kolo expresesd the neede for us to get a move on because his product has bad efefcts the longer it goes on. Myron led everyone on a turtle quest. WE headed in the back way adn we had a bit aof a deabte/fight about what to do if it was being sneaky or not. Somehow the plan became to do some shoots and then just go for it. THe universe was uspet.</p>
<p>Myron led the way and bellowed “heroes in … heroes with the shieled.. “. It was inspiring. Kolo killed a puppy word and then i managed to catch up. I didnt know what the plan was so i just euthanised one of the doggies with my gun. The big red guy started runnign at us, myron took a shot but it just pinged off him. The other orcs all started runninig too and closing in us again. Dave jar view. Myron stood bravely while the rocs just tried to hit him but could not. Rippy turned up. We felt bad for forgetting him again but he does feel absent. Myron is left handed btu he often forgets. He started wailing on the orcs and just kept going slashing and firing and slafhign and firing. Suddenlt there was a giant squawk that was so loud, and a creature started swooping down into the room. It was a griffin (don’t know hw to spel that) and the red man jumped onto the griffin. Kolo started killing and I lined up a myron bullet and it was a good hit on the red man and his griffin. Rippy killed an orc. But mre kept coming. So many. This job started off being just about killing a few orcs. Kolo thinks we’ve actually what weve really did is just genocided a orc village. The red man did a battle cry and threw a spear at kolo. Kolo didn’t even care. So many orcs started wailing on myron and rippy. Rippy’s influence was great for us and myron and kolo just kept shrugign off laods of the attacks. Bernie said he didnt know what to do, myron rolled his eyes and shouted “kill orcs” as he was still being hounded by like 5 orcs who could not even hit him ha. BErnie shouted “gabrins attack pattern beta”, which was confusing because we have not ever discussed our tactics with him and pattern beta refers to when youre setting the table and put the kinfe on the left and the fork on the right to add some fun to the meal. The griffin flew at me. ME. it attacked me with its claws but rippys influence meant it didnt hurt so bad. I backwards rolled to bernie and shot the red man and his grififn again with explosion bullets. Theyexploded everywhere hahahahah. Rippy got whippy and whipped the guy so good, really satisfying crack to it. The red man jumped off his griffin at me and did three I kid you nto THREE attacks at me. Luckily rippys effects helped a lot and the golden lion armor kicked in whichalso helped because otherwise i would not be alive anymore. EVEN MORE ORICS CAME RUNNING IN. It was getting hard to tell what was going on because crazy amounts of blood and orc meat everywhere. Bernie came up to the red man and grabbed his throat with the electric gaunlet and shouted at him “HERES YOUR KALIMar”” which was the coolest he has been all day (and to be fair he was being cool already). The red man lit up like a winter solstice tree. He yelled at me to finish him. Myron carried on slewing through orcs shouting at us that our job is to kill the red man and his job is to hol dback the orc whoredes. The griffin tried to grab me which it couldnt and then it tried to claw but it could not. Stupid bird. Kolo tried his daggers but he didnt look so healthy on his toes and his hands looked weird like flowers to him. I shot the red man and his chest exploded with blood splattering everywhere. As he felel the red paint formed around the hole and he just got back up on his feet and said “Kalimar” again and he looked mental angry. Probably not good. The red man walked up to bernie and just hit him over and over and over and over, so gorey. It was getting silly how many orcs were here. Bernie missed a stab. This griffin just wont give up on me but luckily its pretty rubbish. Kolo seemed to come to his sense and he legged it, grabbing me by the hand and we ran back and then turned round and did the all time classic GABRIn DOUBLE SHOTARU!!!!!! Striaght into the red man. Rippy kept being whippy. The red man turned to a bleeding barely standing bernie. It was an ominous moment. Bernie fell from his hit and it didn’t look good. Myron was surrounded by 15 orcs I kid you not. The griffin went for rippy It’s not a very useful griffin. Kolo lined up his shot and destoryed the red man once and for all. I ran up and helped bernie with a gun zappy. I watched the red man lie on the floor the red ooze puddling around his decimated body. I passed out breifly, myron had 8 orcs attackhim but shrugged it off. Then the unthinkable happened! The griffin got riphard and flew him away. We could not even see him. He is probably dead. Kolo and I chased the griffin down and took aim unleashing an almost deadly barrage.</p>
<p>Riphard knew only he could save himself, he prepared his whip and gritted his teeth, and whipped it at disadvantage and whipped it to death, 50 ft in the air. He fell along with the dead griffin and kept singing his song as he fell, landing with little more than a gentle thump. Riphard is a fucking hero.</p>
<p>The orcs descended on bernie and myron whilst kolo and i saw to rippy. Bernie survided that by the skin of his teeth. They tried to hit myron but ineffektual again. The guy is so dreamy. Kolo and I just started picking off orcs. At this point it wasf just mopping up the last orcs and mop up we did. Kolo did do a sweet belly slide along the ball bearings as he shot the orog. Kolo also did another roll and picked up benries crossbow and kept mrudering. Bernie finally killed somethign and it was the last one.</p>
<p>Myron stood in the place hed stood all fight, looked smug and said “strats and stats turtle brothers, strats and tats”. Too right. We all layed down and enjoyed a bit of being alive. After a while we had a look around, and founda big hole full fo red goo that went dep dep dep into the earth. Myron said he could hear depp bestial roars from afar. I took a sampel of the goo for later to analyse. We seracehd around but couldnt find so much apart from bones and basic equipment. Little bit of money. Kolo tried to give myron 1000gp. He is kind and good at sharing. Myron and Rippy went off to host a feast for the orc hareem on his weird snow man wolf meal he made. They are emancipated now.</p>
<p>WE decided to throw th elast bundle of the dynamite into it because why not? Then we blocked it up with rocks.</p>
<p>Well that was our day dear diaryf. To be honest i cannot really believer that we didn ot all die buat you know what, sometimes you shuldnt question life. We all had a really nikce day and literally genociked a whole orc population and i think we have all become better frineds so overlal I would rate the orc cave as 110% fun.

    <textarea readonly class="source" rows="20" cols="20">Dear diary,

Well, Kolo got Stanri killed last week but he did his job and protected Kolo so I guess alls is wells that ends wells. I was gonna rebuild him anyway with some new secret plans that I have made up in my head anyway so it is not even that much of a problem. His metal brain is still in one piece so we won’t lose any data. I managed to cobble together a couple of new tricksy trick things from his scraps to help us in the dungeon to make up for the lack of claws and teeth.

After the excitenment of last week we decided we were going to have a little restsies and took over the lovely camp. I stayed up to watch out wih Kolo but I was ever so tired and I could feel my gabrin eyes getting heaveer and heaveer. BUT THEN Kolo shouted out that something was coming. Kolo was straight into action and fired a bow and/or arrow at it. He was shoked by the extra surprise that his bow was able to extra surprise the creature that at that point none of us could even see. Myron tensed his muscles and got ready so I got ready too. Riphard went to take a look and was all like “bloody hell” and did a shot. I don’t know what came over him but for once his shooting was top notch. It’s lyke he was a new man almost. The monstaer came ito the room and me and myron did our shots and shot it good. The perfect couple ;) It looked horrid and was like a big white thing with horns and did roors of angerand ice came out of its mouth everywhere. Kolo went down immediately. Bernee ran to help him up and told me to kill the thing. A big ask. Myron was all vcovered in snow like a snowman and triedd to kill the thing but his gun was all full of snow. I was inspired and shot the thing and i was so furious and then i threw the mideicne to bernie to give to kolo but i was also really neervous about him and then rippy was touching himself and then he was smiting the thunder everywehre. The big creature looked down at myron and then myron stopped moving, cold as ice. Bernie dragged kolo back to the fire and give him the medicine and then hes better and walkingabut again. Kolo was straightback into his bowing and he was furious of the small. Myron looked back at the monster and suddenly his coak like snapped and all the ice just like flew off him amazing. I told kolo to get back to me and I shot the thing and shot it so hard because bernie and it’s head explaoded. I helpled kolo with the elctircity to make him feel good. Riphard went to myron and helped him get more feeling better. Our mouths dropped. Since when coud riphard even do this?? It was amazing.

Kolo and I went to work and kolo cstrated cutting it all up while i ran a little scane. It was so much quicker when i could use stanri to do the scans. I made a couple of armors for peopel and gave it to kolo and myron. Burnie asked about my shakey device. How could he know about this????????? I literally only invented it today and have neve reven used it. Kolo tried to pickpoket the files tha burniee is always hiding. He said it just had a middlee fingger picture in it. Why is he studying fingers???? Tricksy.

Myron did another talk to us to motivate us abotu not dygin. Burnie tooko the monster skinss. He also put his fist into the wargg and put some snow monsterer meat into its bottom. Myron took the kokokola. I hope its still goood after all theat time at th ebottom of bagsy. Kolo had one too and they gave eachtoher a shared look, a knowing look of shared experience. That look still haunts me….

Senpai and kolo led the way down the corridor where the snow monsetr was. Kolo and myron were acting a bit odd. We went into a big room that was “decidedly empty”. Just fire and hooks and a pen. Kolo ran into a little house screaming giddily abuot the magic house. The war drums wer still banging and they were much closer now. Much closer. Bernie otok a moment to apprecaite the arkitectuer. Myron called a huddle. He said the ackshun was donw the slope and offeredn us too ways to go: cut off the head of the fish and see whats inside, aor not go there and go and see the others to see if anyone was going to bother us while we were bothering them. Kolo found more houses. Myorn said “look look look look look look”. And then he said we were going through the little one but all sneaky. Something is not right with these two. Myron ran back to get his pack which he lefat by the fire and took a moment to appreshiate the scent of burneis meal cooking.

We passed through a narrow sseries f ocracks in the walls. Burnei was checking for traps after we had already walked through everywhere. After some crawling we could finally see fire in the disatnce. I left the boys to talk about tortoises and sneaked forwadr to see what was going on. It lokoed liek a celebration and there wer two big orcs there and there were loads of orcs. Oh god myrona nd kolo were being so loud. I checked bagsy and found kolos clear liquid and his speed powder. I thought carefully and decided to give them to kolo. He knows best I am 110% sure. 110%.......

Kolo was the first to act. Of course he was. He sneaked off into a hut and awalked like a tortoise there, and then he was pretending to be what looked like a sausage rolling along the roof. It looked like he was trying to get the hookah pipe. I told him to put on his armor but it looked like there awas a problem. I heard the “wwhummmmp” from where I was and so did the orcs. It was on. Kolo sprang to action faster than bernie. “TORTOISE TO ME” he said huffing the white powder like a champ. A champ who knew no fear at alll. He started to swell up all over, his little gabrin face and arms swelling up. Bernie said he heard somethign about them celebreating the blessings of kalimar. Kolo came back to us. Bernie took a flask of oil and put a hole in it and then didn’t. He stepped forward breavely shielding kolo and gave us a smile and raised his sword. The big boys ran at him. He headbutted them really hard. It was cool and the first one just dropped like a pigeon. Myron looked at me and he said “stay here stay safe, no matter what happens ill get your borther out”. So hot. So so hot. He just jumped and crashed down and started shooting like a boss. Rip is here too we remember. Myron put kolo on his shoulders and kolo started singing his swollen song “goblin turtle ninja power”. I told rippy we needed his help and killed an orc. The biggest boy walked through the flames and shouted out “kill them for kalifar” in a very scary way and he made the orcs attack. THey couldnt even hti them hahahaha. Rippy stepped up and hesitated and thought and then he blessed his bullet sand even killed it (he was being so good today) and then what he then did was he reloaded really fast and then he shot another orc and he killed aother one. This is amzing. I was in awe. I think we all were. We never knew he was capable of this. “I hate these green slimy bastards….and the orcs”. I was not even mad. Kolo was on it too “TURTLE POWR!!!” and just destroye danother orc. Bernie found himself feeling very aloen at the fornt of the battle. Myron ran up to help him as he got hit lots and just went mental with his gun pacifier and the orog didnt look so smug anymoroe he didnt and was bleeding heavily. Bernie was all like “you aint working for kalimor we are” which didnt make sense but then he fainted and then he sworded them more and then he dodged randomly. I loaded in a myron bullet and waited. I waited and waited, steadyyyyy steadddyyyy and then the big guy came close enough and i shot that fire hell at him and his friends. One orc just exploded and the other orogs looked bad. The big guy just kept goingg!!! And he was going towards myron !!! Rippy stepped up again and was so nonchalant. He just shot an orc without killing it, regressing to the mean. KOLO DIVED IN “TURRRRTLEEE POOOWEEERRRR” aiming his knives at their ballsakcs. BOth died, clutching their uselss testicles, wondering where they had gone so wrong in their lives. Kolo wore them like puppets. Horrible testicle puppets. Bernie fainted and attacked the little orc and then it was nt alive anymore. He let out a rather lame “totem power” missing the point completely once again. Myron threw his bayonet into him and i tried to shot him but bernies voice annoyed me and i was worried about hitting myron. Why does he think kolo would be sayign “totem power”?? Rippy had another go but regressed to the mean even more. Kolo kept screaming about turtles tat burnie while he rolled around on his knees trying to hit the big man but he couldnt because of the outrage. Bernie shouted “time to end this” and I laughed. Against all odds he actually killed the big man. Just like that. I could not even believe we survived that. We were so surrounded. Epic

We didn’t even have any time to rest, kolo just ran off faster than we could catch him. He came into a large room and another load of orcs and a big orc and wargs and the big orc had red paint on his face and he was talking to the others. The big orc was looking at a big hole in the ground, and he puleld ouap the handfuls of the red stuff and but it on his face. Bernie sadi it lokoed like a blood orgy and he had been to a few. I don’t know what an orgy is. Myron grabbed kol and told hi they were turtlel buddies anf that they had tomaximiese their turtlel power by coming back and then we could make a bottole neck to attackk. Kolo expresesd the neede for us to get a move on because his product has bad efefcts the longer it goes on. Myron led everyone on a turtle quest. WE headed in the back way adn we had a bit aof a deabte/fight about what to do if it was being sneaky or not. Somehow the plan became to do some shoots and then just go for it. THe universe was uspet.

Myron led the way and bellowed “heroes in … heroes with the shieled.. “. It was inspiring. Kolo killed a puppy word and then i managed to catch up. I didnt know what the plan was so i just euthanised one of the doggies with my gun. The big red guy started runnign at us, myron took a shot but it just pinged off him. The other orcs all started runninig too and closing in us again. Dave jar view. Myron stood bravely while the rocs just tried to hit him but could not. Rippy turned up. We felt bad for forgetting him again but he does feel absent. Myron is left handed btu he often forgets. He started wailing on the orcs and just kept going slashing and firing and slafhign and firing. Suddenlt there was a giant squawk that was so loud, and a creature started swooping down into the room. It was a griffin (don’t know hw to spel that) and the red man jumped onto the griffin. Kolo started killing and I lined up a myron bullet and it was a good hit on the red man and his griffin. Rippy killed an orc. But mre kept coming. So many. This job started off being just about killing a few orcs. Kolo thinks we’ve actually what weve really did is just genocided a orc village. The red man did a battle cry and threw a spear at kolo. Kolo didn’t even care. So many orcs started wailing on myron and rippy. Rippy’s influence was great for us and myron and kolo just kept shrugign off laods of the attacks. Bernie said he didnt know what to do, myron rolled his eyes and shouted “kill orcs” as he was still being hounded by like 5 orcs who could not even hit him ha. BErnie shouted “gabrins attack pattern beta”, which was confusing because we have not ever discussed our tactics with him and pattern beta refers to when youre setting the table and put the kinfe on the left and the fork on the right to add some fun to the meal. The griffin flew at me. ME. it attacked me with its claws but rippys influence meant it didnt hurt so bad. I backwards rolled to bernie and shot the red man and his grififn again with explosion bullets. Theyexploded everywhere hahahahah. Rippy got whippy and whipped the guy so good, really satisfying crack to it. The red man jumped off his griffin at me and did three I kid you nto THREE attacks at me. Luckily rippys effects helped a lot and the golden lion armor kicked in whichalso helped because otherwise i would not be alive anymore. EVEN MORE ORICS CAME RUNNING IN. It was getting hard to tell what was going on because crazy amounts of blood and orc meat everywhere. Bernie came up to the red man and grabbed his throat with the electric gaunlet and shouted at him “HERES YOUR KALIMar”” which was the coolest he has been all day (and to be fair he was being cool already). The red man lit up like a winter solstice tree. He yelled at me to finish him. Myron carried on slewing through orcs shouting at us that our job is to kill the red man and his job is to hol dback the orc whoredes. The griffin tried to grab me which it couldnt and then it tried to claw but it could not. Stupid bird. Kolo tried his daggers but he didnt look so healthy on his toes and his hands looked weird like flowers to him. I shot the red man and his chest exploded with blood splattering everywhere. As he felel the red paint formed around the hole and he just got back up on his feet and said “Kalimar” again and he looked mental angry. Probably not good. The red man walked up to bernie and just hit him over and over and over and over, so gorey. It was getting silly how many orcs were here. Bernie missed a stab. This griffin just wont give up on me but luckily its pretty rubbish. Kolo seemed to come to his sense and he legged it, grabbing me by the hand and we ran back and then turned round and did the all time classic GABRIn DOUBLE SHOTARU!!!!!! Striaght into the red man. Rippy kept being whippy. The red man turned to a bleeding barely standing bernie. It was an ominous moment. Bernie fell from his hit and it didn’t look good. Myron was surrounded by 15 orcs I kid you not. The griffin went for rippy It’s not a very useful griffin. Kolo lined up his shot and destoryed the red man once and for all. I ran up and helped bernie with a gun zappy. I watched the red man lie on the floor the red ooze puddling around his decimated body. I passed out breifly, myron had 8 orcs attackhim but shrugged it off. Then the unthinkable happened! The griffin got riphard and flew him away. We could not even see him. He is probably dead. Kolo and I chased the griffin down and took aim unleashing an almost deadly barrage.

Riphard knew only he could save himself, he prepared his whip and gritted his teeth, and whipped it at disadvantage and whipped it to death, 50 ft in the air. He fell along with the dead griffin and kept singing his song as he fell, landing with little more than a gentle thump. Riphard is a fucking hero.

The orcs descended on bernie and myron whilst kolo and i saw to rippy. Bernie survided that by the skin of his teeth. They tried to hit myron but ineffektual again. The guy is so dreamy. Kolo and I just started picking off orcs. At this point it wasf just mopping up the last orcs and mop up we did. Kolo did do a sweet belly slide along the ball bearings as he shot the orog. Kolo also did another roll and picked up benries crossbow and kept mrudering. Bernie finally killed somethign and it was the last one.

Myron stood in the place hed stood all fight, looked smug and said “strats and stats turtle brothers, strats and tats”. Too right. We all layed down and enjoyed a bit of being alive. After a while we had a look around, and founda big hole full fo red goo that went dep dep dep into the earth. Myron said he could hear depp bestial roars from afar. I took a sampel of the goo for later to analyse. We seracehd around but couldnt find so much apart from bones and basic equipment. Little bit of money. Kolo tried to give myron 1000gp. He is kind and good at sharing. Myron and Rippy went off to host a feast for the orc hareem on his weird snow man wolf meal he made. They are emancipated now.

WE decided to throw th elast bundle of the dynamite into it because why not? Then we blocked it up with rocks.

Well that was our day dear diaryf. To be honest i cannot really believer that we didn ot all die buat you know what, sometimes you shuldnt question life. We all had a really nikce day and literally genociked a whole orc population and i think we have all become better frineds so overlal I would rate the orc cave as 110% fun. Time to go get stanri :) x x x x
